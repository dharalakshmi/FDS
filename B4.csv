Not to mention, the cute pink packaging it comes in makes it all the more exciting to use. I have used many products that aren’t Kylie Skin but I will continue to use the Vitamin C along with the Walnut Face Scrub in place of other brand products I used daily in my skincare routine. That’s all I have tried so far but I am super excited to try all the other products. I strongly recommend both products to all!",Kylie cosmetics,positive
