Foaming facewash,"really good! gets rid of the bumps on my skin and the packaging is perfect with the texture of the foam. there isnt a strong scent to it and
texture feels amazing on the skin.",kyliecosmetics,positive,1
Foaming facewash,I really did not enjoy the smell of this cleanser really hard to explain a clean soap smell but bitter. It isnt the most WOW of cleansers and the brand name is more reflective of the price than the actual quality of the product. I wouldnt buy this cleanser again.,kyliecosmetics,negative,1
Foaming facewash,"I like the smell of this product,super neutral but at the same time it has a nice scent.Also after using this my skin is super soft, Im just not a fan of foaming face washes. The one thing I dont like about this is that it leaves this aftertaste on my lips.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1

Foaming facewash,When I first got this it was clear a couple weeks went by and it has turned dark brown. Very strange made me not wand to continue to use.,kyliecosmetics,negative,1
Foaming facewash,This is a nice face wash that that leaves your face clean. It becomes foam as you pump it out. I would apply moisturizer after since it can make your face feel dry. But over all it not bad when you really need cleansing.,kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Foaming facewash,"This foaming cleanser isnt amazing in any way. It have a nice fragrance to it which is nice but definitely dries out your skin. I have naturally oily/combo skin and my old blemishes were begging to be picked at when the edges dried out. No allusions, this is very drying!",kyliecosmetics,positive,1
Foaming facewash,"I really enjoy this face wash. The packaging is true Kylie. Sleek, baby pink
and very minimalist. I love it. The actual face wash is very gentle.It foams
 upon being pumped from dispenser. I love the way the foam feels on my face. And i truly love the way my skin feels afterwards.",kyliecosmetics,positive,1
Foaming facewash,"There really isnt much of a scent which appeals to me.I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't so pricey. I absolutely adore this face wash, but it definitely doesn't fit its price point. With that said, we only live once and you should at least try.",kyliecosmetics,positive,1
Foaming facewash,"I like this cleanser, its great for a skincare beginner routine. It does not remove makeup so I would suggest using a makeup remover or double cleansing with an oil or balm before.",kyliecosmetics,positive,1
Foaming facewash,"But I love the foaming aspect of it, its very soft and gentle. It also has a slight fragrance which I personally like but that could affect those with sensitive skin. My skin doesnt feel tight/dry after use which I like too.",kyliecosmetics,positive,1
Foaming facewash,"I was a bit nervous when I purchased this, because I'd heard people mention that it's either great or stripping and causes breakouts, but I ended up loving it and noticed it cleared up my acne.",kyliecosmetics,positive,1
Foaming facewash,I love using this face wash as it creates a lot of foam and makes my skin feel so clean after I use it. Its smell isnt bad either and packaging well.,kyliecosmetics,positive,1
Foaming facewash,I really like the foaming face wash. It removes makeup well. I love that you only need one pump for a whole face and it lasts a long time. It's very foamy but at the same time very creamy too. It has a good smell.,kyliecosmetics,positive,1
Foaming facewash,"I feel as if this face wash does what it says. Its nothing special or to write home about. I have repurchased this product twice. Probably not going to a third because theres so much more out there thats really good for your skin, at a better price.",kyliecosmetics,positive,1
Foaming facewash,I've been using kylie skin now for almost 4 years And I love it. It's kept my face so clean smooth and clear of acne. At first in was hesitant because it's another celebrity putting out a product. But the results speak for themselves.,kyliecosmetics,positive,1
Foaming facewash,"I got this product in one of my subscription boxes. since it was a new product line from Kylie, I was somewhat skeptical. followed the easy to read directions and with a light warm wash, my face felt so incredibly soft and breathable!!

Foaming facewash,I really liked this foaming face wash from kylie skin when I first got it. But it has turned a dark brown after 6 months. I'm not sure if it's safe to use now. Even if it was the color is extremely of putting. I wouldn't use this now if it was safe. It's ashame I really wanted to like this,kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Foaming facewash,"Love this product Really helped with the oilness on my skin,made it much better, honestly one of the best face washes that I have tried",kyliecosmetics,positive,1

Foaming facewash,I compared this product to other face foaming washes I have and its basically the same thing. It only took two pumps so very little product and it left my skin glowing. I would recommend this product for all skin types.,kyliecosmetics,positive,1
Foaming facewash,This was an okay cleanser. I thought it did an average job on cleansing my skin during the winter months. The scent was very pleasant. The foam lathered very luxuriously.,kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Foaming facewash,"it really didn't clean my skin as well I would have thought. I used this as my second cleanser whenever I wore makeup, and it did not do the job. Soon after, I tone. I saw on my cotton pad that there was still some residual dirt left on my skin.",kyliecosmetics,negative,1

Foaming facewash,Have to get another one of these . This takes off make up so easily! Only need a pump or 2. And stubborn mascara off! Havent tried the face creams . But this is definitely a winner for me,kyliecosmetics,positive,1
Foaming facewash,I wasnt expecting it to be this good to be honest! I got the small version in a box to try out first. And yes after cleaning my skin felt really good. I wouldnt use it to clean away makeup but overall its a good nice cleanser,kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
