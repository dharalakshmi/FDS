What a great product! Lets start with the vibrancy of this combo! 10/10, definitely recommend! Its not drying at all and it almost feels buttery on the lips while still maintaining its matte. Its not a product that lasts all day, but they can take my monies!",kyliecosmetics,positive,1

Lip Kit,"over rated
This lip kit was all the rage when it first came out but I think there are now better products out there. The liner is buttery is goes on pretty nice but the liquid lipstick is pretty drying. Id say for the price and the way it performs Id rather buy colourpop.",kyliecosmetics,positive,1

I love the lip liner. The color is very vibrant and a good match with the lip color. Lip color is also velvety going on and color is super cut. But after it dries down my lips feel stiff and dry. And after removing it my lips are super dry, need tons of lip balms",kyliecosmetics,positive,1

I like how the lipstick feels on the lips, its very thin yet ultra pigmented. The lip pencil is very soft. I would chose a different color next time because for me its a little to light, I like darker color personality.",kyliecosmetics,positive,1
Lip Kit,"love it!!! just not as an everyday wear.
I was really satisfied with the color I chose, it looks great against deeper toned skin. My only thing is I like more of a glossy lip look and of course Its going to be a little drying because its a velvet lip kit, but overall I really liked the product.",kyliecosmetics,positive,1

I love this shade its beautiful for a nude, it stays for the majority of the day but does leave my lips a little dry, but just throw some gloss overtop and its perfect!",kyliecosmetics,positive,1

I was very disappointed in this product. The lip liner was okay and applied fine, but the liquid lipstick was a bit much. It is very pigmented and easily stains your skin. It also dried very quickly and made the stain look uneven in color. Overall, would not recommend",kyliecosmetics,negative,1

Application was easy and looked nice on. I dont think the color was right for my skin tone but still a nice shade. It was the first Kylie product Ive tried and was pleasantly surprised.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"matte
This is a great lippie if you are looking for a matte lipstick. I wish it matched my lips more, it is more redder than it looks in the pics but still pretty. The matte isnt over drying and it looks pretty",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"good
I don't like the color, however, it looks of good quality and is soft. but I had to wait more than 15 minutes so that it does not transfer to other things",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1

The lipstick is a bit brighter than expected but lays well on the lips still a bit on the dries side even though it it a velvet formula.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"it's ok
It's my first time trying out Kylie Cosmetics Velvet Lip Kit -  Bare . I like the shade and it glides smoothly when applied. The lip liner has a darker shade which is a bit disappointing . All in all I feel that these lip kit helps  achieve that pouty lip look .",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"the pencil is everything but the color is ok
I love love the lip pencil. It glides very smoothly. The lip color is ok perhaps its not what I expected when I saw the color as a sample. I take one star off because it didnt last long enough.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1

Its got a nice feel, but it doesnt stay on like the matte does",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1

Beautiful color and long wearing but dries out my lips.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"fun
This is a cute Lip Kit. Im not a huge fan of liquid lipsticks but the velvet ones are nice. I still prefer a glossy look. The color is great for Valentines Day, I probably wont wear it that often though. The lip liner formula is good. I would recommend to people that often wear red lipstick.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"nice color
The color is so pretty but unfortunately it doesnt stay on long enough. It feels great to put on, so smooth, but once applied it immediately dried out my lips. I wore it for a few hours but it was coming off on everything I was eating and drinking.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"lip liner yes!
I love the formula of the lip liner unfortunately the color (Harmony) did not look good on my skin tone. Liquid lipstick in harmony the formula was not consistent while applying it wasnt opaque & had a runny texture.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"soft but slightly sheer
The lip liner is very soft and velvety, it does not match the liquid lip 100% but it is close. There is a slight scent to the lipstick that is not offensive. The packaging feels cheap to me. Dries down kinda shiny which is nice and doesnt feel too drying.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"its a pretty color
It looks lighter on my lips I like the formula but I prefer matte liquid lipsticks,I would like it better in another shade.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"good formula
I like the formula a lot, but this shade was a little too light for me. I have a deeper complexion with some olive undertones and this shade just ended up giving me concealer lips.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"pretty color
This color is a little light for me so I have to pair it with a darker lip liner but it looks really nice. It is drying but its a liquid lipstick so I expect that out of it. Im usually not a fan of kylies makeup but this isnt too bad.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1

Lip Kit,"kylie lip kit
I have never tried anything from this brand but obviously there has been a lot of controversy around it.

The lip liner was my favorite part about the kit it performed really well. The liquid lip feels light on the lips and fades nicely.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1

I prefer this velvet formula over the original matte formula from years ago because it looks better on the lips. ",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1

Color payoff was very good. Can never go wrong with a classic red. Creamy consistency but longevity wasn't there for me. Transferred pretty easily even after letting it dry.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"not impressed
I tried this on alone & wore for maybe 3 hours & I didnt like it alone . it didnt last as long as I thought . Although the finish of the lip product is nice and didnt dry my lips out . I ended up using it as a topper with brown lip liner and gloss .",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"good, not great
I really wanted to like the Kylie lip kit. I used the product several times before coming to a conclusion. The shade is really nice and subtle. However, I didnt like the application. It went on almost splotchy and didnt look smooth. I would definitely recommend the lip liner.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"not my favorite
I receive the 700 bare velvet color, but isnt my favorite nude color because is too light for my skin tone, I have another favorite nude lipsticks but this is not good for me. I like the lip liner because is indelible.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"not good for dry lips
it was very dry and patchy. better to use just the liner with gloss of your lips are more chapped. other than that its amazing",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"not that good
I was really looking forward to trying this to see if it actually worked, and it does make your lips look bigger. Sadly, I did not feel very comfortable using it, because it is pretty dry. I dont think I would purchase it.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"didnt like the shade
Personally the color was too pink for me and not applicable for brown skin. I was excited for getting this product but the shade was not it for me.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1

I liked the product however the color I received was not as shown in the pictures. It went in smooth and didnt feel dry.",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1

I was glad to receive the Bare Velvet formula lip kit, but was disappointed in the lip liner color. The liner seems to dark to match the color lipstick. I did however enjoy both formulas",kyliecosmetics,neutral,1
Lip Kit,"disappointed
Honestly I had such high expectations for these products. While the lip liner itself is decent (applies smoothly & is creamy) I didnt really care for the lipstick. I know its supposed to be matte-ish but I found it to be very drying",kyliecosmetics,negative,1

24 hours claims is kinda fake. It will peel off if you eat or drink anything. The inner part of your lip will have no product and it will feel gross on your lips. It was flaking and peeling off.",kyliecosmetics,negative,0

Lip Kit,"cheap product
I was very disappointed in this product. The lip liner was okay and applied fine, but the liquid lipstick was a bit much. It is very pigmented and easily stains your skin. It also dried very quickly and made the stain look uneven in color. Overall, would not recommend",kyliecosmetics,negative,1
