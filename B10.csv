It is expensive however I like to get this brand sometimes because it’s good quality. I would definitely recommend this to wear for a night out.",kylie cosmetics,positive
kylie Highlighter,"i like this product,
I like this product, no doubt! It is super bright and shimmery. The one thing I don’t love is that it is still a little sparkly. Not too bad but I personally don’t love a ton of sparkle on my highlighters.",kylie cosmetics,positive
kylie Highlighter,"i like the highlight
I like the highlight color but it’s not very blendable and looks fairly cheap on the skin",kylie cosmetics,positive
kylie Highlighter,"it does a pretty
It does a pretty good job highlighting. I use it mostly for the corner of my eyes. It is highly pigmented and a little goes a long way.",kylie cosmetics,positive

kylie Highlighter,"i swore i would
I swore I would never buy anything from a Kardasian , then I did. This product is ok. I guess it depends on the light and how it hits your face. The finish was flat , I most likely won’t buy again.

kylie Highlighter,"i grabbed a few
I grabbed a few of these on a whim. I am a sucker for highlighters. I love these, although they are a little pricey when the quality is similar to some new drugstore highlighters. I only say that because out of 4 I bought 2 were broken. They seem to crumble kind of easily. They are not blinding, but they blend very well into the skin rather than smear on top like some drugstore versions I find. On days I’m not looking to outshine the sun, I gravitate to these for the perfect amount of glow.",kylie cosmetics,positive

I’m only giving this 4 stars because it’s not that shiny but if you are into a good highlight that isn’t that much glow this should be the one for you !! It’s very buildable. I would probably not buy this again as it’s kinda pricey!

It’s pretty and long lasting. The powder is pigmented and creamy. However, it’s more on the glittery side. There can be pretty chunky sparkles in there.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"somewhat alright
Great shine but was not sealed in its compact so It could fall out any time. This is not my first product that has been unsecured.Luckily I bought on sale. Maybe that’s why they put things on sale",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"good highlighter
The highlighter has a shimmer, but I would say that it is more glowy on the skin. It isn’t so opaque so it can be blended out for a more natural highlight if you like. I like it, but my issue with this was that when I opened up the highlighter it fell right out of the pan and onto my floor. I was able to pick it up because it stayed intact. It has a putty texture, not exactly powdery. I put it back and it stays for the most part. Not a bad product, but I didn’t expect it to fall out like that.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"just ok.
It's ok. Doesn't really show up on the brush to apply",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"very icy
This was a gift with purchase from Ulta (i don't purchase from this brand) and this shade was a little too icy for my skintone. This was a miss for me.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"it’s no different than my drug store brands
I really wanted to love this, is it awful? No. Is it the best? Ehhhh, not really. It had shines the way a highlighter needs to, but not the shine I was expectin",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"kylighter
This highlighter is just a basic highlighter! I honestly think this is just ok! But if you aren’t huge on highlighter it’s a decent one",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"too much integrity
Very bright highlighter….only need a small dab!!!!

",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"nice
Wish this showed up a little more on my skin. Takes a little while to build up.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"chunky glitter didn’t blend well
Chunky pieces of glitter , didn’t blend particularly well. There are plenty of much better alternatives out there",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"it will give you
It will give you a nice highlight but it is very obvious that the highlight is artificial and doesn't give a natural appearance. Will use in a pinch but I prefer more of a natural highlight.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"not for me
I really wanted to love it but i Didnt like the formula too chalky, i wouldnt repurchase, didnt blend well at all still sitting in a drawer new",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"it’s just ok.
It came broken. The highlighter itself is ok. I’ve had better quality in other brands in the same price range. Nothing I would buy again.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"it's ok as long
It's ok as long as you have the correct brush to add it to face. Doesn't stay on too long for me. I love the color tho.

kylie Highlighter,"highlighter
I’m not a fan of this highlighter. I can barely see it when I apply it to my face. I’m more of a super shimmery blinding highlighter person and this didn’t give me that.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"durchschnittlich
Schönes Design, niedliche Verpackung.  Leicht aufzutragen, angenehmes Tragegefühl. Ich persönlich empfinde den Geruch des Highlighters als ungewöhnlich.  Kann nichts was andere Highlighter nicht auch können.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,Totally disappointed with this highlighter.,kylie cosmetics,negative
kylie Highlighter,"i was excited to
I was excited to try this, as I love Kylie cosmetics and they are typically very pigmented, but the brightness was minimal and I expected it to be brighter. Not pigmented enough.",kylie cosmetics,negative
kylie Highlighter,"good not great! it
Good not great! It does the job but I do like other brands more, the packaging is super cute and I love bringing it for travel. I’ve dropped it a ton and it has still not broken. Overall it’s worth the price",kylie cosmetics,negative
kylie Highlighter,"it was a good
It was a good product overall and I got it in sale for a very cheap so it made even more sense for me in terms of value for money.",kylie cosmetics,negative
kylie Highlighter,"i enjoyed this highlighter
I enjoyed this highlighter until the end of my day. I used a champagne however as the day went on it made my cheeks look gray. I love for short term wear however for long term wear I would not buy again.

kylie Highlighter,"standard highlighter. it’s nothing
standard highlighter. it’s nothing special. i do like that it goes on very smooth and doesn’t have large chunks of glitter. i’d describe it as a natural glow finish. if you want to pay the price, then sure i would recommend it

",kylie cosmetics,negative
kylie Highlighter,"highly pigmented to give
Highly pigmented to give you a illuminating glow, gold undertones and very shiny, only downfall is the price, quite pricey when you can get cheaper highlighters that work just as well. Maybe would buy again",kylie cosmetics,negative
kylie Highlighter,"i like it but
I like it but it just has to much high lighting dust coming off everything I use it but it does shine bright like a diamond",kylie cosmetics,negative
kylie Highlighter,"it’s ok but nyx
It’s ok but nyx powder much better and less priced so I choose nyx powder my opinion saves my money and almost the same quality both same way save your money guys to new product I don’t like it so much Kylie Cosmetics Kylighter Illuminating Powder",kylie cosmetics,negative
kylie Highlighter,"very nice shade would
very nice shade would be better for deeper skin tones, i am fenty beauty shade 230 and it leaves me a little bit of a cast… very glitter as well has sparkles in it just be carful with the packing because it can break easily.",kylie cosmetics,negative
kylie Highlighter,"i have this product
I have this product and I will buy it again. I recommend you give it a try as well. I was not disappointed. I love love and love it.

kylie Highlighter,"i like the kylie
I like the Kylie blushes and highlighters the pale pink is so pretty easy to apply and love the pink packaging however it’s not my very fav certainly one to hang on to!!",kylie cosmetics,negative
kylie Highlighter,"i don’t think this
I don’t think this product is any better than other brands. It does apply nicely but I would rather save money and buy a less expensive alternative!",kylie cosmetics,negative
kylie Highlighter,"it takes a ton
It takes a ton to get 5 stats from me. It's an ok??? It has too much glitter its like jstar but not as bad.. I definitely like it better than jstar",kylie cosmetics,negative
kylie Highlighter,"i believe that this
I believe that this product has very good intentions but personally I don’t like too crazy of a highlighter look and this powder is very shimmery and if you like to have a golden skin tone like me this gives you a very silvery skin tone so if this applies to you I do not recommend!?",kylie cosmetics,negative
kylie Highlighter,"the highlighters are hit
The highlighters are hit or miss. The one from the holiday 2018 is the best with its shimmer. The ones at Ulta are so underwhelming. Princess Please was a gift and it’s barely used.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"it is okay. i’ve
It is okay. I’ve had better highlighters. It does have a lot of fallout. Wouldn’t buy again.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"in terms of highlighter,
In terms of highlighter, I just found this product to be, for lack of better terms, mid. It was just okay. I was excited because I generally enjoy Kylie products, but it felt overpriced for what it was. I've enjoyed drugstore highlighters more, and most likely will not be purchasing again. I'm going to finish it because theres no sense in throwing it away, but not super exciting.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"i really wanted to
I really wanted to like this product but unfortunately, it did not work out for me. This product is very pigmented but it was hard to blend out and emphasized all the texture on my cheeks. I also felt like this was more glittery than radiant which I am not a fan of. I sometimes will use it for a slight highlight under the brow-bone for an eye look.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"honestly not my favorite.
Honestly not my favorite. The product is not super pigmented. I got this on sale but probably wouldn’t buy again for full price.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"i did not love
I did not love this highlighter but I also did not hate it. Very meh in my opinion. Not good or bad, did not stand out.

",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"i love using this.
i love using this. it’s very shiny. it’s not easy to blend though. it sort of stays where you put it. but it’s still a nice highlighter!",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"got this as a
Got this as a gift for my birthday, the color is pretty but it is slightly chalky. I use it to highlight my cheek bones but it is not my favorite.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
kylie Highlighter,"this product leaves a
This product leaves a nice highlight. However it does seem to be a little chalky. You definitely will need to wet it somehow such as with a setting spray on a brush. For the price I wouldn’t buy it with so many better cheaper options your paying for her name.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
