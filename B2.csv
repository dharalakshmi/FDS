Eyeshadow palettes,"good product so far packaging dirty and gross
Product good. Packaging dirty and gross. Was a present for teenager with all her friends, was a big deal to get fancy Kylie makeup and it was un presentable. I had to take it out of its box and wrap it. ",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"excellent palette
Great neutral palette. All colors applied smoothly and pigmented. The shimmer shades were a super fine glitter that exaggerated the texture on my mature skin eyelids, but they worked fine as eyeliners and highlighters. ",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"smaller than i expected but good colours
Lovely colours but item was smaller than expected. I loved all these bronzed and metallic tones and when I ordered this I was very excited. I use this as my daily eye palette but it came half the size I expected. I normally buy makeup revolution palettes which are the sizes I expected but it’s very compact. ",kyliecosmetics,positive

Love this palette for everyday looks, fairly pigmented, would buy again",kyliecosmetics,positive

The shades themselves are all pretty well pigmented. There’s a lot of the same shade but that’s expected in a brown palette. They’re is a lot of fallout but it brushes off very easily",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"nice, but the og bronze palette is still a winner
While I love this palette, I used to have the original bronze palette, and I can't say I didn't hope for similar quality with this one. I love the shades, where the palette is lacking for me is the quality of the actual palette.",kyliecosmetics,neutral

I like the palette a lot it has all the nude tones you need. But not much color payoff",kyliecosmetics,neutral

Pretty colors. Would have been nice to have an applicator included.",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"pretty good, 4 stars
The palette is gorgeous and I love the variety of colors! Payoff is good, wearability is good. There is significant fallout with “she’s golden” and it smears everywhere if you don’t use makeup remover to get it off. It also was the first and only color to crack when I traveled with it. Overall I am pleased and will probably just not use “she’s golden”",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"bronze pressed powder palette
Love the colours, very pigmented, easy to blend. I use the darker colours for eyeliner and it worked just fine. Wished there would be one shimmery shade instead of just the glitter ones but other then that, I really love it.",kyliecosmetics,neutral

Eyeshadow palettes,"cute shades but used pallete
Cute shades but my eyeshadow came smudged and out of the pan like it had been used. There was no plastic wrap on the product to cover the shadows. The cardbiard was huuuge and so wasteful and not eco friendly.",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"lots of packaging for a small palatte
I love the colors and the names! Definitely need to use a primer or concealer to bring out the pigment. Long lasting, didn't rub off. ",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"would have given 5 stars, but …
Great product, but the packaging is excessive and not environmentally friendly. The triangle box is clever, but that box in the big box that has to be shipped in an even bigger box just isn’t necessary. Otherwise, 5 stars for the actual product.",kyliecosmetics,positive

The palette of eyeshadows are very lovely, the colors are amazing.",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"kris x kylie 2.0

Eyeshadow palettes,"pallet is okay, not great.
I love the matte shade colors. Hey Matt is my favorite color in this pallet. I was looking forward to the glitter shades but found they have to much fall-out. I like this pallet but wouldn't buy it again. Its a little over priced for its quality.",kyliecosmetics,positive

loved the application. went on smooth and very pretty",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"brush issues
Really like it, but the brush is a little big making it difficult to manoeuvre.",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"great stuff.
Great stuff. It does bleed a little onto lower lash after wearing throughout the day, esp if your eyes water a little or if you have allergies, go for a run, etc.",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"please release a waterproof one
My eyelashes are straight and I always use an eyelash curler to curl them. So I'm usually someone who has to use waterproof mascara for the curl to hold. I was excited to try this since it said it holds the curl, but unfortunately it didn't hold for me :( other than that I loved the formula! Please release a waterproof formula for us that need it",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"not too shabby!
Awesome, but gets a bit flaky. Doesn’t smear or clump, just feels dried out once it’s been on for a little while.",kyliecosmetics,negative
Eyeshadow palettes,"works some what
I like the mascara it works. I don't have falses looking lashes but it does give me some longer lashes",kyliecosmetics,neutral

really good quality i like it a lot and it makes my eyelashes rlly long",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"skincare
8pc skincare is everything each mini is enough until refill",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"better than telescopic
it smells good. can be a lil clumpy but it is a good mascara and i use it all the time. (i like it when my eyelashes clump a lil)",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"flakey
I love the way it looks on, and it the way it goes on. But it flakes so so bad. It’s very annoying when it flakes into your eye ball and you can’t get it out, and then it makes your under eyes looks dark because it flakes so much. ",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"almost perfect 
Really great once you work it through your lashes.",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"kylie you did it again!
it’s a great mascara! it does have a little fallout at first but I haven’t noticed any flaking or smearing under my eyes!",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"it is good for daily use
It’s good for daily use and easy to remove love you Kylie from Saudi Arabia",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"good quality - no clump
What I like about this mascara compared to drugstore mascaras, is that it doesn't get clumpy, dry or too wet. I wouldn't say it lengthens or thickens much though. But it's a great everyday mascara for the office.",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"not that great for the price.
Lifts and lengthens your eyelashes. Only thing I do not like after a few hours is that it starts to flake.",kyliecosmetics,negative
Eyeshadow palettes,"aniqa asif
I brought this a year ago and I have to say it's good. It's a shame I won't be buying anything anymore though ????",kyliecosmetics,neutral

It appears to be on the dry side. I don’t know if that’s normal for it or if it truly dried up.",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"ok masacara
It's very ok macara , do what she does but need more layers and its dry over time",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"mascara
Not as much coverage as I’d like but it works! Not enough to leave my normal brand",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"just okay
This mascara didn’t wow me like I expected. It is a wonderful black color and has a nice brush. The container itself feels and looks of nice quality. Unfortunately the mascara flakes, not horribly but noticeable. Sadly, I won’t be purchasing this again.",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"not my favorite
A bit thick and clumpy. Does not stay on all day. Does wipe off easy with water or makeup remover pads.",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"had high hopes, but just mediocre
Love the packaging and gave me volume, but did not lengthen like other mascaras I have tried. Also clumps",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"kind of droopy
Pretty good but not the best. Kind of clumpy. Not waterproof at all! Doesn’t fan lashes individually. Flakes off somewhat. It’s very heavy and makes my long eyelashes bend and curl in the opposite way I want and droop down.",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"flakey
I love the application and how it looks but I have to use a curler to get the volume.",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"pretty good
The brush is a little large and leaves globs. The mascara stays on good, doesn't irritate your eyes. I would probably still purchase again.",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"not my favorite
The brush is HUGE! I couldn't get it under my lashes to even coat them because it was that big. I pretty much just threw this in the trash because I couldn't use it.",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"good quality
I’ve got this mascara to give it a try and it actually did a pretty good job and lifts great!",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"game changer
The formula is truly volumizing without clumping, providing an instant lift to my lashes. It effortlessly adds length and definition, creating a wide-eyed effect that lasts all day. ",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"volumizing but gets crusty
It is very volumizing and gives a wispy effect on lashes however, after a few hours, it gets crusty/flaky and gives my under eye a panda look.",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"mascara
Great mascara but unfortunately it was extremely clumpy and dried out.",kyliecosmetics,positive
Eyeshadow palettes,"so so
Not as good as what I expected. Have to apply a lot of it just really see it.",kyliecosmetics,negative
Eyeshadow palettes,"i’ve had better
It’s ok. Not worth the hype or the price . Could be better",kyliecosmetics,neutral

This mascara is great for volume but it dries and becomes flaky",kyliecosmetics,neutral

Not a major difference I have had better mascara from the hair store",kyliecosmetics,negative
Eyeshadow palettes,"don’t waste your money!
Brush is horrible!!! Brush us toooo big! You can’t use the end of it because it’s flat..",kyliecosmetics,negative
Eyeshadow palettes,"pretty but very dry
It’s a nice wand and does go on pretty but my review is only 3/5 stars due to how dry of a mascara this product is. And the flaking when it’s set is pretty irritating.",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"it’s ok
Not bad but not the greatest. I’ve had better ones.",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"product flaked
Product went on well and looked great, but this product DOES flake off a lot and leaves a mess under your eyes like most products do.",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"decent mascara
Overall it was ok, not the best and not the worse - it was very sticky and a $12 price point is more appropriate",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"not worth the hype
The formula is very thick. It doesn’t last for a long period of time. If you do the full two coats your eyes feel extremely heavy. Definitely won’t be buying again.",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"flakes
Packaging was lovely! The ONLY issue I had was that this mascara DID flake off!",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"alright
It starts to cake up pretty quickly in the day with racoons eyes. I like how full they are when I start but mid day at work little pieces get in my eye. Requesting a waterproof mascara.",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"disappointed
It clumps and I’m disappointed. I had high hopes because I thought it wouldn’t clumpy lashes but it did and it’ did not elongate or curl them.",kyliecosmetics,negative
Eyeshadow palettes,"ehhhh
Its just alright, didn't last half the day and it took forever to get shipped",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"lengthen but is flakey
it does lengthen my lashes but it flakes off, leaves black specks around my eyes",kyliecosmetics,neutral
Eyeshadow palettes,"doesn’t stay on
Love the way it went on, but unfortunately if your eyes water at all or if you’re greasy it’ll be down your face.",kyliecosmetics,negative
Eyeshadow palettes,"eh
Didn’t do much for my lashes. Maybe the full size is better.",kyliecosmetics,negative
Eyeshadow palettes,"clumps up
I recently started using this mascara and so far, I’m not loving it. I love the brush BUT the actual mascara clumps up too much.",kyliecosmetics,negative

I have used better mascaras. This one needs few coats. Flakes bit. Easy removal. Nice color. Not my favorite",kyliecosmetics,neutral

Leaves clumps on eyelashes and not a very good texture. It comes out feeling dry.",kyliecosmetics,negative

Feels cheap but pricey. It does make your lashes fuller and thicker but the brush is so cheap that it came crooked.",kyliecosmetics,negative

Little disappointed. There was no volume or lift. Made my eyebrows sticky. Cheap",kyliecosmetics,negative

Was very underwhelmed with this mascara. Was expecting a lot based on the packaging, marketing, and more and it was just really not that impressive. I likely built it up too much…",kyliecosmetics,negative

rolls into lumps, does not layer and has a poor composition. Not worth the money and very disappointing",kyliecosmetics,negative
