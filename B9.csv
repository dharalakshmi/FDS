My favourite lipstick ever. Does not dry out your lips, finishes in a nice Matt colour that feels like a second skin. The lip liner is also very soft and smooth on your lips. Would highly recommend. Much better than other brands in",kylie cosmetics,positive

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i love it!
I've had so many complements on this lip kit. It dries down enough that it lasts, but not to much that it looks dry or matte. It does need a few re-applications if you are eating and drinking, but I'd expect that with all lipsticks anyway if you want to keep a fresh look!",kylie cosmetics,positive

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"color depiction is not accurate
I love this lipstick. A co-worker turned me on to it. I love everything except that the colors displayed online do not represent the actual colors. I have ordered 3 different colors attempting to find my shade. Unfortunately, the no returns or exchanges policy is causing me to not want to buy anymore. I can't afford to keep buying shades just to find out that the colors are all wrong.",kylie cosmetics,Negative

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"absolute hit 
Miss Kylie has got an absolute hit on her hands with this formula!!!! Not only is the color of this lip kit so universally flattering, but also the formula itself is SO COMFORTABLE. If you’re an OG Kylie lipkits follower, you know how her mattes can feel somewhat dry and emphasize lip lines - but not the velvet series. Now, this formula is far from transferproof but it does have good staying power (I didn’t feel like I had to reapply after eating). Honestly, I’d gladly buy more colors in this lip kit formula.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love the creamy
love this demi matte cream wish there were more colors! Gives a color that has a matte appearance without the dry crusty sticky that comes with most matte lip colors.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"nice color
i love that i got to try out a color that was so popular & i never got a chance to get my hands on. the formula of her lipsticks are great. it’s the one product i consistently but from her. & this color is worth it",kylie cosmetics,positive

Nice item, shame about the service. supposed to get a free towel with this duplicate order..no show",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good diff formula!
Back when these released in like 2015 or 2016 I was so obsessed w the formula and really matte lips. After the last couple of years I haven’t really worn it much because it was too matte and dry on the lips. I feel like Kylie changed the formula and i’m back to really enjoying this lip product! The color Harmony was a bit too light for my liking but I will definitely purchase more colors w this new formula! :) highly recommend!!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"kylie cosmetics
Love this lip combo, I never owned a Kylie cosmetics product but this made me definitely want to try out more stuff from this brand. I’m a nude girl so the color I loved it",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"very shocked!
Usually Kylie lip kits are very dry but this formula kept my lips smooth. The color is also so amazing and aren’t sheer at all! Definitely worth the try especially with if you’re used to the Matte lipsticks that dry your lips out.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"kylie cosmetics has come a long way
Excellent pigmentation and formula. Compared to a lip kit from years ago, much better. The color is beautiful and it feels comfortable to wear. As good as a lot of other prestige brands, I will have to buy another color or two",kylie cosmetics,positive

It gives you that “soft” look while still being bright! I love how it applies and am excited to try other shades! 100% a must have in your makeup collection!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i love this lip kit… and i was surprised !
I have never tried anything from Kylie other than one of her highlighters I got as a gift one year. I liked the highlighter but it wasn’t anything special or different from so many others. So I was just never interested in trying anything else from her line. I have to say I was so surprised when I tried this. I loved it right away. The liner is a slightly different shade from the lipstick but it looks so nice layered. I was really surprised how long the lipstick lasted because it’s not a true liquid lipstick that dries matte. I will definitely be getting some more colors and I highly recommend!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"awesome
Amazing! Love this! Both colors are absolutely beautiful.",kylie cosmetics,positive

(I’m on the right in the picture) I absolutely adore this lipstick. it’s my go to every single day.

The formula is very comfortable on the lips. The color is pigmented and a beautiful red shade.? Can be worn as a little dab of color or as a full liquid lipstick.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"buttery soft lip kit 
I typically never wear lip liners but this was super easy to use. The liner was so creamy and glided smoothly, making the application processes be extremely easy. The liquid lipstick was also creamy and soft. I was expecting for the lipstick to dry out my lips but it didn't at all! I loved how the combo lasted throughout the day. If anything I only had to make one minor touch up. I high recommend anyone to try this! Plus the scent smells so yummy and sweet!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"super soft on the lips
Liked this formula wayyy better than her original liquid lipstick formula. All though it dries the same way it doesn’t leave my lips cracked and the application looks super smooth.",kylie cosmetics,positive

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"nice set
Nice colour, very similar to the one on the site. The lip pen writes very well. I will buy another set.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"beautiful color
I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review from Influenster and Kylie Cosmetics. At first when I tried on i wasn’t wearing makeup and my lips looked pale. I wasn’t too sure if I liked it because the color is more on the pink side and I use a bit darker color since my skin complex is darker. Got ready and tried it on and I love it. My sister told me this color looks nice too. It does lasts hours so I’m very happy and I will sure buy another color other than this",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"The perfect formula
This was my first time trying Kylie Cosmetics, and her lip kit did not disappoint. As the product description says, the formula is highly pigmented and glides on effortlessly. This liquid demi-matte lipstick is truly the first of its kind. It has a non-drying texture which makes it incredibly comfortable to wear. It also has a subtle scrumptious vanilla scent. Of course with all of these great features, the kit retails at $32, which is on the higher end for lip kits.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love it
I was a little hesitant as if I would like this color and formula, but I actually loved it! It was so smooth & the color was perfect. I received a lot of compliments and the color lasted pretty much all day long. I will buy another one for sure! This item is incentivized complimentary in exchange for review.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"best red lip kit in the world

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great duo
The Kylie Cosmetics Velvet Lip Kit is a great duo of liquid lipstick and lip liner. I loved the color, Posie K, which has a nice dusty rose pink color. The liner applies smoothly and evenly. The liquid lipstick also goes on smooth and then dries into a nice matte finish, lasting well.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"bold lip
Wasn't sure if I would like the bright barbie color, but I actually do. It's a fun shade even compared to my fair complexion. Smooth to apply and I only needed one coat.

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"beautiful and comfortable!
I used to be obsessed with Kylie lip kits when I was young. It has been a while since I last tried a Kylie lip kit. It’s my first time trying a velvet lip kit, and I really enjoyed it. Matching lip pencil makes everything so much easier. This product is very comfortable on the lips because it is velvet. I have nothing bad to say about it because I love velvet lipsticks and glosses more than a Matte lip especially in the winter time. Give these a try and you won’t regret it!",kylie cosmetics,positive

Once it dries it stays on the lips for hours. It also feels velvety and comfortable on the lips.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"soft matte
Smells like buttercream, pigmented, and a soft matte finish. I really love this and I didn’t think I would. It has a beautiful finish that looks good even with dry lips in the winter. It’s not transfer proof, but it does last a long time. It wears down gracefully and doesn’t just disappear when you eat something. Feels good on the lips too. I recommend this if you see a color you like! I like the lip pencil a little more than the cream because the pencil is even more matte than the cream, but together it’s a winner!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"kylie for the win!
Absolutely adored this color and lip kit. This is the bare velvet. Such a perfect nude color with just enough tint of color. It is not permanent and does wipe off with normal wear but I only have to reapply maybe 2-3x a day. Love this kit so so much! Thank you for the opportunity to try!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"posie k color - must have
This lipstick set is beautiful. Nice packaging. The lip liner is so smooth and soft. The liquid lipstick color is great too but after awhile it feel a bit dry. Remember to exfoliate and hydrate your lips before applying liquid lipsticks. Thank you so much Kylie Cosmetic & Influenster ",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"harmony
Harmony is a nice shade a pink that I really like. The lip liner was smooth to put on and easy to apply! I like how the lip gloss was glossy when applying then became a nice matte color when dried!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love it
i never tried Kylie cosmetics before and i know understand why it is so good and everyone is talking how soft and great it is. I am loving this color and would possibly use it every few days to look great with light makeup on",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"so smooth!
Love the way the pencil applies to the lips, very smooth and silky I feel like when you want to dress it down the pencil alone even would be enough. The lipstick also applies nicely, a little can go a long way. It dries quickly and stays on a while!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"new favorite!
I am so in love with this lip kit! The shade is absolutely beautiful and so pigmented and the scent is subtle but delicious. So creamy, goes on perfect, and is definitely my new favorite",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great!
I got the shade harmony which is a very pretty pink color. The texture of the lipstick is very smooth and creamy which makes it a good option for those of us who like to wear lipstick all day without having that dry, crusty feeling on the lips. Definitely recommend!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"long lasting
This is my first time trying out a Kylie lip kit, and it didn’t disappoint! At first, the lip liner seemed super bright when I applied it, but it blended in well with the lipstick and looked great! It was long lasting and easy to blend while wet. Once it dries, then it’s stuck on your lips. It did come off after I had dinner, but I’m still satisfied with this product.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"pleasantly surprised!!
This lip kit is amazing! The pencil is smooth and very well pigmented, so it the lipstick. It stays fairly well while you eat or drink as long as you're not eating anything too messy/wet. Definitely recommend bringing the kit with you if you're going out so you can reapply if needed. I prefer this product to ones that claim to be ""all day"" or ""smudge-proof/life-proof"" because this did NOT dry my lips out after wearing for hours. The shade was super cute and flattering too!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"a happy first!
This was my first time trying anything from Kylie Cosmetics. I feel I lucked out a bit with the shade, I would honestly be too scared to purchase most of the shades blindly without being able to see them in person first. Like some reviewers, I do agree the liquid lip formula is drying, but I have yet to try a liquid lip from any brand that isn’t drying. Considering the lovely velvet finish, the smooth result I got from pairing it with the lip liner, and the fact that I wouldn’t be wearing this color all day long anyway, I think this kit is a pretty perfect version of what it is",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"bright and stayed all day!
I loved this kylie lip kit. The pink is BRIGHT, which I love. I put it on in the morning and it stayed put for at least 10 hours with eating and drinking. I will forever buy the kylie lip kits!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love it!
I was a bit skeptical of this color at first but I ended up loving it. I like that it comes with the liner and gloss. You def need to use both of them for the longest wear. It lasted hours even through drinking. I can’t wait to try more colors!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love it
This is my first time ever trying a Kylie lip kit and now it won’t be my last. I LOVED it, so creamy and went on really smooth. The colors were perfect together and literally such a great shade for me. The formula wasn’t clumpy or too drying. The packaging is iconic and I’m super happy, I’ll be recommending and purchasing for sure",kylie cosmetics,positive

I really enjoyed the lipstick, it’s staying on your lips for a long time. The texture is amazing and it’s looking great!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"Lips
I really like Kylie cosmetics and that fact it comes with the lip liner. But this color was a little too pink for me I like more darker lipstick but it was a easy fix I just added a darker purple to it and it came out very nice. I would definitely be getting more colors of this brand.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"awesome lip combo
I really liked this lip combo! It’s the perfect pink for me! And the liner really is so smooth. It just glides on perfectly!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i received compliments all day
I received a little kid at no charge to me. I was skeptical of the color however I received compliments the entire day. The applicator goes on smooth it does not dry your lips or pill the color last all day. I would definitely recommend this look at and I will be trying other things thank you and for monster for sending me the vox",kylie cosmetics,positive

I do love the liner. The lip color seems like more of a stain to me. Was much more bright then I anticipated.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"one of my favorites
This lip liner especially was amazing. It went on so smooth and lasted for hours even with eating/drinking. The shade was the perfect nude for my skin tone. I also loved the velvet liquid lip, if complimented the liner perfectly and felt so comfortable on my lips.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"perfect pout
The new formula is incredible. This product provides the perfect pout and glides on like a dream without any stickiness or dryness.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"say no more - my new favorite pink!
I was a little afraid of the color at first for this Kylie lip kit, but it is amazing! I wore it to dinner and got so many compliments on how vibrant it is. It stayed on all night with no smudging through drinks, dinner, and a few hours of hanging out after. The only con is that it dries your lips a little which is normal for a matte product, so moisturizing before is a must. Loved this one!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"the perfect red!
I loved this velvet lip kit so much. I have one of her mattes and it’s a bit too drying but her velvet formula is spot on. I got red velvet and it’s the perfect red. 10/10 would recommend.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"run don’t walk to purchase this
i am OBSESSEDDDDD with this lip kit. the packaging, the pigmentation, the formula, all of it is perfect. i love red lipstick but sometimes it’s hard to find a liquid red lipstick that doesn’t bleed all over the place and stays on. this kylie lip kit is perfect. it goes on smooth, lasts for quite a while, and is not super messy to put on. definitely making this a go-to red lipstick.",kylie cosmetics,positive

At first I thought it was way to bold of a color but when I put it on it looked absolutely amazing!! You only need a little bit!",kylie cosmetics,positive

Love the color. So bright & perfect for summers and four night outs. Changes the entire look of a simple outfit. Love the texture.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"kylie’s lipstick duo
This was my first time trying a Kylie lip kit. I’ve never used lip liner before, but the liner in the Kylie lip kit goes on so smoothly! And the color stays on for a while and doesn’t dry out your lips. It’s easy to use.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i loved it!
First of all I love how smooth is the application! Both the lip liner and the lipstick  Smell really good, I don’t feel my lips sticky or cracked after a couple of hours using them. I don’t usually use pink lipstick because I thing it doesn’t look nice on me but this one absolutely changed my mind!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good value
Love that this set comes with a lipstick and a lip liner - Greta value for the money that it is on the market for - would recommend",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i love the texture
This goes on very smooth and matte. I like how it doesn’t feel over drying once you apply it like other matte lipsticks. This color on darker skin just doesn’t look good though.

",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"perfect red pop!
I love Kylie lip kits, and this color is no exception. The red color was perfect for a fun night out. The matching lip liner made it easy to apply, and the pigment was long-lasting. It even stayed on through dinner and drinks.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"obsessed
I am OBSESSED with this kit! I am not a “bright” lip color kinda gal, but I received the Say No More shade and I love it! Both the liner and the lipstick go on so incredibly smooth and the color is so fun! I’m so obsessed I’m going to go get another shade for everyday wear. Then I’ll have a night out shade and an everyday shade. Thank you!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"so creamy and smooth!
Loving this Kylie Lip Kit! This is my first one and I’m impressed! The lip liner glides on so effortlessly as does the lipstick. The color Charm is a perfect nude and looks so natural. Really love this product, would purchase in the future!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love the color
I have a love hate relationship with matte lipgloss but I always love the Kylie lip kits and this color is perfect for every day wear. I change it up sometimes by adding a gloss on top too.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"very buttery and smooth
I’ve never tried Kylie cosmetics until now and I’m pleasantly surprised…the formula applies very smoothly and doesn’t dry out your lips!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"the perfect nude.
The liner is awesome. It's smooth, creamy & distributes pigment evenly. I actually like to do my entire lip with it. The liquid is a bit drying (as most matte liquids are), but not as drying as Smashbox. It wears well without cracking, or flaking. It's not drink proof.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"this shade is my absolute favorite.
I love this Kylie lip kit. It has an amazing soft texture, beautiful shade and coverage. The fact that it is cruelty free & vegan always adds an extra plus to my reviews. Absolutely beautiful lip kit.

I've never tried Kyle cosmetics products before and I'm pleasantly surprised! The lip liner was very creamy and pigmented and lasted all day. I liked the lipstick as well, I topped it with gloss because that's the look I prefer and it looked great!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"worth buying!
This lip kit is smooth on my lips, and I love the shade! I'm super pale, and it's hard for me to find lipsticks/glosses/etc that I like against my skin, but I've only ever had one from Kylie Cosmetics that I didn't like(and that was years ago).

",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i will order another one in this shade
I was surprised by how much I liked this product. It came with a lip liner and a matte liquid lipstick, that was the perfect shade for me. Application was smooth and it lasts a while before having to reapply.",kylie cosmetics,positive

This was my first time trying the Kylie lip kit in the shade posie k and I have to say I was amazed with the long lasting effect. The lip liner is creamy and very pigmented. The lipgloss is super moisturizing and easy to blend. I could easily eat a whole meal and not have to retouch. I must say I am impressed. Definitely want more shades ??",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"pretty color
I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The shade Bare is such a lovely color and the liner goes in like butter. My main concern is sharpening the pencil since the product breaks off easily and is easily wasted. So I used the lined my lips with the liner followed by lipstick which is very moisturizing and the best part is it doesn’t feel dry on lips. The shade is amazing to create the ombré look. Loved it!!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love this color!!
This is my first time trying these product from this brand. This Party Girl Velvet Lip Kit is the perfect duo for creating a velvety, demi-matte lip look. This Velvet Lip Kit includes a Velvet Liquid Lipstick and Lip Liner Pencil. These are Clean, Vegan, Cruelty Free and Gluten Free. This lip pencil has a super creamy formula that glides smoothly on the lips. It provides a smudge-free lip contour. This velvet liquid lipstick has creamy, lightweight formula that's easy to apply. This lipstick comes with a soft applicator and has a light vanilla scent. I feel comfortable when wearing this Kylie lip kit. I love this color very much - viriant pink.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love the packaging and smoothness
This lip kit set is moist & creamy, smooth and lightweight. The liquid lipstick and liner held about 4 hours my first try before my lips began feeling dry and the lipstick started creasing. My second try I prepped my lips using a lip balm beforehand and the liquid lipstick lasted longer. In honesty Im not a huge fan of the color on me. The color is very nice, but it doesnt do anything for my skin tone or bring me out. The lip kit is cutely packaged and extremely smooth. While this color doesn't fit me I would like to try other colors.",kylie cosmetics,positive

i absolutely adored this lip kit!! the packaging is completely gorgeous - from the box to the tubes for the pencil and liquid lipstick - and super functional as well. i also loved the formula, because for a fairly matte lip i found it to be very comfortable and moisturizing. the color is also gorgeous, and i will consider purchasing it in the future!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"first time lip kit user
was so excited to try out a lip kit since I've never managed to get my hands on one! I made a bold choice going with the red velvet shade, but it has paired so nicely with my makeup looks! I'm not typically one to wear a full lip, I usually blend it out the center for that popsicle lip look! the formula was very very soft and easily blendable! i also love the matching pencil, it leaves no room for guessing when finding a liner. the product feels super lightweight on and stayed all day long, my only complaint is that it easily smudges. not a super big deal considering most lipsticks do! overall it's really nice!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"liked it
I’ve tried a few Kylie lip products before and they used to dry my lips. However, this one felt a little moisturizing and the color payoff was great! The lip liner was very easy to apply as well.",kylie cosmetics,positive

I got the shade “Bare”. I’m obsessed with the color, it’s the perfect light nude! Formula isn’t as drying as her other liquid lipsticks and wear time is good!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"glides on effortlessly, and looked natural!
I’m not usually one who wears lip stick or uses a whole kit! But when I tried this Velvet lip kit by Kylie cosmetics I instantly realized what I’ve been missing out on. It’s not only a pop of color, but it looked natural and semi matte. The perfect combo for me! Absolutely loved getting to try this complimentary product out!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"absolutely love this
I love the pigment and the packaging. It is a great lipstick and lipliner duo and works amazingly without making it look patchy and dry.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good quality , less pigmented
I liked the quality it lasts long and doesn’t leave my lips dry. However I was expecting it to be more pigmented for the shade I received. Overall I liked it might go for a darker shade next time",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love the shade!!
I own a few Kylie Lip Kits but haven’t tried any since she changed her formula. I was happy to see they still smell good and the pigment is still great! I wore this color all day and reapplied once but if you’re careful with eating, you should get by with just one application and maybe some lip balm to even out the color throughout the day. Poise K was one of her first shades but I’ve never tried it until now. I love it! No wonder she’s kept it a staple in the brand. If you haven’t tried, I recommend at least getting one lip kit for the experience",kylie cosmetics,positive

Okay I’m a big fan of Kylie Lipstick already lol but the durability on this one is insane. Also the color is a perfect mix of pink and nude-ish.",kylie cosmetics,positive

I was soooo excited to try this product and it did not disappoint. I followed the instructions on the package and I loved the look! Harmony is a fun, pink color, but not super bright. I like the muted hue. The gloss on top of the liner really finished off the look. Plus, the packaging is adorable. I’m a big fan!",kylie cosmetics,positive

I appreciate it but the color for me was a little off but I'll still wear it. The consistency is good. the product is good",kylie cosmetics,neutral
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great kit!
I loved the Kylie Velvet lip Kit!!!! From the packaging, the pencil to the liquid lipstick. The color would not be my first choice (party girl) but after trying it I loved how it looks. It is a slightly striking tone and they make the lips stand out very nicely. They are easily applied. First use the pencil to outline and fill in with liquid lipstick. I liked the result. I received this product for free from @kyliecosmetics and @influenster in exchange for my honest review. #incentivized",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"smoothest liner
I would definitely recommend this lip kit. The liner was absolutely buttery. It didn't tug on my lip at all when trying to apply it and it easily filled in my lips. The liner itself give a huge payoff with just one swipe same with the liquid lipstick. They don't have very much staying power and will easily wipe off but still leave some color. The liquid lipstick is not sticky as long as you only put a thin layer which is all you really need. The finish doesn't seem to be fully matte but I also wouldn't call it satin and definitely not glossy. It seems to be more matte with a slight gloss but looks more matte if you blot.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"long lasting beautiful color
Wore this all night for New Year’s Eve and it lasted great. No sticky texture, very light weight and the color was vibrant. I loved it! I never bought the Kylie lip because of the price, but after getting to test it I definitely will be looking into more colors. Worth every penny!",kylie cosmetics,positive

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"really nice
I’m a brunette with super dark eyes and some blonde in my hair, my skin color has yellow undertones. This is a very nice color, but I think it would look better on someone with a lighter complexion. The product is nice, only issue is that it feels a tad bit chalky. If you moisturize your lips before applying you should be good. It lasts really long.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"nice feel
This has a really nice texture on my lips… The color is darker than what I Thought it would be?. Also the lip liner doesn’t come with a lot? But overall I really liked these products and I am going to buy them in a different color?",kylie cosmetics,positive

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"surprisingly good!
Was expecting this to be very dry as many liquid lip products are for me. The lip liner was good to include as well and matched.

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"Liquid lip
First of all, not hydrating at all, it makes my lips look crusty? and even if I apply lip gloss over it, my lips would still show the lines of my lips and be ugly of a look in general even if I'm going for the natural big lips look. It just didn't work. Another thing, why are the colors being more orangey tone than showing pink tones. Like packaging and advertisement, it? shows what the colors should look like on any skin tones especially fair(ish). For me since I'm fair and ginger (freckles all over and natural red, aubrey) I have tried the Koko K and One Wish, I was hoping for good colors on me but when I wore them they were warmed and orangey tones.",kylie cosmetics,positive

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"beautiful and creamy
I love a good neutral lip color that I can use with any look. This color is just that! The formula is really creamy and applies very smoothly. I like that it does not dry out or become too cakey. For me, the color is just a bit too light but I paired it with a darker lip liner and it is perfect! It can be worn for a day look or on a night out. It does not dry up or make your lips look dry in any way. It is a versatile shade with an amazing formula. Would definitely recommend!",kylie cosmetics,positive

This kit contains a lipstick and a lip liner in the same tone (Charm). Has a beautiful packaging, both are easy to apply, the liner is super smooth and doesn't hurt the lip when applied.

I got the party girl color. It is a really pretty bright pink. It is not a color that I would normally pick for myself, I feel like it wasn't the right color for my skin tone. It is a very nice kit though. The liner goes on smooth and silky and the gloss isn't sticky and gloopy like some others I have tried. I tried just the lip liner by itself, and the gloss by itself, and then followed the directions and did both of them together and I liked it all 3 ways. Very versatile. I would reccomend to anyone, and I liked it enough that I am going to purchase a shade that I like better for myself! 10/10",kylie cosmetics,positive

I absolutely love it it’s super pigmented slides on fine and stay on and the lip liner is magic I just love the color so much",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"pretty color
The pencil glides on so smooth and the color is really pretty. It reminds me of quite a few of the NYX products. I feel like it’s pretty pigmented and provides even coverage. The pencil and liquid lipstick are an accurate match. I don’t wear pink much in the winter but can’t wait to wear this in the spring.",kylie cosmetics,positive

I have so many lip kits from Kylie cosmetics but didn’t have this one. I am so happy Influenster sent me this color. This is so beautiful on my skin tone. Smooth and beautiful absolutely love it.",kylie cosmetics,positive

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"loving the new nude pink and formula!
As soon as I swatched this liquid lip I knew this would be my new go to lippie. The shade is the perfect nude pink and the liner that it comes with has a beautiful neutral tone for a solid lip contour. The lip liner took quite a bit of effort to remove which is a win in my books! Excited to try other shades from this line!",kylie cosmetics,positive

The first time I tried a Kylie product, it officially became one of my favorite lip products. It is long-lasting and the color is beautiful. I recommend it, it's an excellent option for New Year's gifts",kylie cosmetics,positive

It was my first time trying Kylie cosmetics and I was super impressed! The pencil is creamy, pigmented and applied smoothly. This was such a beautiful shade ",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"beautiful color.
The color is beautiful. I like how the liner glided easily on my lips. I also liked how easy it was to apply the lipstick. Although I really loved the product I don’t think it suits me. I will definitely be buying a different color since I loved the product so much.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"really good!
I absolutely love the lip liner! It goes on oh so smooth! And the lipstick lasts longer than any other brand I’ve tried. It doesn’t dry out my lips like other brands. Even though I received this product in the cold month of December when my lips tend to dry and chap more easily it was still a great addition to my collection. Overall, I am in love with this product and color! Only con is that the color was transferred to drinking glass and straw when drinking. I do recommend.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great products!
This lip liner and liquid lipstick are great! Long lasting formulas and the color is beautiful! Would definitely recommend it to everyone.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"buttery creamy hydrating fairly long lasting
My title kind of says it all. The formula smells yummy like cake. It goes on so smooth and soft and creamy. It’s semi matte but lips feel very hydrated. I’m always impressed when I use Kyle’s lip line and I forget and then I use it again and I’m reminded how great it is! Now the color- Party Girl.",kylie cosmetics,positive

The pencil it’s so smooth and buttery! I love this duo and how pigmented it is! I love to have matte lips but I have dry lips so the matte lipsticks makes mi lips dryer and I don’t like how they feel, BUT THIS IS MAGIC! It is matte but without the dryness! Love love love!!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love this
it for sure lives to its velvet name, but i know kylie always says it works best to line and fill in your lips with the lip liner before the liquid lip, which after my first lip kit doing that, i do it every time i wear liquid lip stick. you’ll get best velvet/in general results if you do it like that. it’ll last longer/better and look nicer anyways!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love!
I didn't expect to love this as much as I did since it's such a vibrant color for me, but the pigmentation is great, and I didn't feel like I needed a lot for it to cover my whole lip. I was really excited to try it, so I put some on without any other makeup just to see if it's good.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love the color!
I ussually wear nude and berry colored lipsticks and this is just perfect for me! Velvet texture is great this winter. I never tried kylie liptsick before but I was so excited it comes with lip liner. hope it has gold staying power",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"such a vibrant color!
I’ve heard mixed reviews on Kylie’s line but these lip products are fantastic! This pink color is so bold and vibrant. Really stays on well, too. It’s a little too bright to wear regularly which is my only complaint. Otherwise I’d love to try the more subtle colors as the product itself is great quality.",kylie cosmetics,positive

This is my first Kylie cosmetics product and I was really excited about the color because it’s really out there.

I thought this was an overhyped beauty product but this is amazing! It dries down so light on the lips and doesn't feel like a film of gloss or heavy. The color may not be for me but I would definitely try out other colors because I really enjoy the formula, it lasted a whole night of drinking so that's also really nice.",kylie cosmetics,positive

The formular is so smooth and lightweight. The lipliner glides on effortlessly and the liquid lipstick holds up to 8 hours. Definitely recommend the velvet lipkits !

",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"definitely better
The velvet formula is definitely better than the matte. It’s very comfortable and I actually like the color on me. I know it doesn’t go with my ugly sweater but I was excited to try it lol the color payoff is there, one swipe does the job. It doesn’t settle in my cracks and it feel very comfy on the lips.",kylie cosmetics,positive

I absolutely loved the formula of the lip liner specifically! I wasn’t sure what the velvet texture would be like but it stayed throughout a family dinner. Definitely recommend!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"buttery soft love the kylie lip kit !
I was so excited when I opened the box and it was a kylie lip kit! And even more excited when I tried the formula and it was so buttery soft and smelled amazing ! The only one thing I would say is that it didn’t dry matte and didn’t last long !",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great!
I was super excited to receive this product! I haven’t tried a Kylie lip product since it’s first launch so I’m excited to check out how the formula has changed it wasn’t drying at all in my lips and this is actually my favorite lip color to wear!",kylie cosmetics,positive

This lip kit is truly dreamy! Definitely one of my favorites I get compliments every time I use it! Love the color matches mostly everything",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"my fault!
I love Kylie lip kits. I have so so many. My favorites. The reason for 4 stars is because the color was a little off from What I thought. It’s no fault of yours but mine. It didn’t look too good on me. I’d love some new colors.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"lasts a long time, durable
I brought this product 2 weeks ago it arrived on time, bit over pricy but does its job.",kylie cosmetics,positive

Its a great product honestly, wish I had more of. Great work to everyone from the warehouse to the assembly line.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great kit
I like the color it's so cool, it was even better than the pictures",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i like the pencil but not the lipstick
The pencil is gorgeous, stays all day long and has a great texture. But lipstick made my lips look dry which is a big disadvantage for me. I’m still using the pencil almost everyday and it lasts long, planning to buy a new one after I finish this.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great lip liner
Great lip liner and color! It is a tad bit light for my preference but overall would be a great natural color on someone who is lighter skin (I am more tan)

",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good lip kit product
The lip liner is great. The lipstick is slightly heavy for me. They are both nice colours and a nice texture.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great product in a different color
I loved the lipgloss and the liner however the color wasn’t a great match for me. I would try again in a different shade. I also think this would look good on a different skin tone! I thought both of the products were long lasting and the gloss was not sticky",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"smooth as butter
i used it and it feels so smooth....easy to use...

",kylie cosmetics,positive

A little drying for the matte lipstick but impressed with the lip liner. I'll definitely buy a separate one. Love the color and consistency!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"perfect color
I have never used Kylie Cosmetics before! I liked the color, it hydrates the lips but it doesn't last long. In a few hours need to reapply again.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good, just one thing…
The only reason I cannot give this 5 stars is because, FOR ME, it dries out my lips. I love the pigmentation. I love the fact that it will probably never come off, I love the matching pencil. I love the brand and packaging. I can only warn that for some reason, I cannot use it without COATING my lips in chapstick. If I want a matte lip, the chapstick ruins that. Could be a sensitivity for me, but just as a note :)",kylie cosmetics,neutral
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"matte dual liner & liquid lips
Not the exact shade I wanted but will will for my high maintain to come back",kylie cosmetics,neutral
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"nice color
The color is nice but it doesn’t last long on my lips.",kylie cosmetics,negative
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love it, but not what it used to be
Huge fan of all lip kits. This color ""bare"" is perfection and my everyday color. I'm obsessed with the velvet texture because it's lasts but isn't drying. However the newer formula is more dry and matte than it used to be. So now I wear it with a gloss.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"we love kylie!
I love the lipgloss to wear on its own but It really stays on when applied over the lip liner. A super neutral tone that is good for any time. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the liner doesn’t come with any instructions on how to sharpen for more product or a sharper to do so.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"easy to use with great color payoff!
The lip liner glides on smoothly and the formula of the lipstick is lightweight and creamy. You may need to reapply during the day but overall a good product",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"its beautiful!!
I loved trying this out! The shade posie k is beautiful! The packaging is adorable but the only down side is that it is quite drying. Ill give it a 4/5 :)",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"drying
the color that i was sent was not the best shade for my skin tone. the formula of the product was kind of dry and emphasized my lip texture. looked good with gloss on top.",kylie cosmetics,negative
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"creamy
It has a great velvet creamy feel but the color wasn’t for me the lip liner went on smooth also. I received this product in exchange for my honest review",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"surprisingly great product
I must say that I wasn’t too sure what to think of the color and the Kylie kit in general. I quite liked it and felt that the color while a little too pink looked good on me. The color was long lasting and I liked the feel of the lip color.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"this was a hit!
What a great product! Let’s start with the vibrancy of this combo! 10/10, definitely recommend! It’s not drying at all and it almost feels buttery on the lips while still maintaining it’s matte. Its not a product that lasts all day, but they can take my monies!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"pretty good kit
The kit includes a demi-matte liquid lipstick that doesn't dry out the lips and the color stays on pretty well. A lip liner is also included and it was nothing special but got the job done. I liked the color as well!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"over rated
This lip kit was all the rage when it first came out but I think there are now better products out there.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"my new go too!
This was my first time trying a Kylie product and I’m very happy. This lipstick goes on so nicely. It gives my lips a nice even color and doesn’t feel heavy, cakey or sticky. The color is a lot pinker than I wear but it has a nice natural color on my lips.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great product not so great color
I loved the formula and lasting power of this lip kit. The liner goes on smooth and the matte isn’t drying. However this color really is for someone who has more fair skin than me.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"it's ok.
The colors are great. The liner and lipstick goes on smooth and looks great. It fells good on your lips and after a few hours it still looked nice but I had to reapply.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"formula is good color was bad
The color did not suit me but the lip liner was so smooth and the lipstick was not drying despite matte. I would try this product again in a different color.",kylie cosmetics,negative
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good
Nice liquid lipstick. It is drying, but wear time was good. Lip liner was creamy and had nice application. If you like bright colors, this one is a fun pop.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"bright!.
I have never used one of kylie's lipkits before but I was pleasantly surprised! This color however was a bit bright for the winter and this time of the year with my skintone. It seemed to go on easily and lasts a long time.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"bold statement
I absolutely love this lippie and lip liner duo! It’s refreshingly so convenient to have both. The formula is comfortable, and although it is matte, it doesn’t leave that dried up, crumbly feel when it dries. The matte lipstick smells amazing, almost like a cupcake. This lip liner is buttery smooth and glides with such precision and perfection. They both compliment each other. The color is definitely bold, so if you’re going for an every day look, this might be a little much. This would be perfect for a date night, or just a night out in the town. Definitely transfer-proof!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"very pigmented!
Now, the color didnt end up being the best for me but its very pigmented which is very nice. A little goes a long way. I woupd be open to buying some of the other colors",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"kylie lip kit
I was pleasantly surprised by this product. The application was very easy and felt great on my lips. It didn’t feel dry at all and lasted very long in my lips. I would definitely recommend.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"matte but not drying and super velvety
Matte but not drying and super velvety. I loved this version of her kits. I already own 8 other ones. I loved it because it had a matte looks but wasn’t drying and didn’t crumble and cake up so it makes it super easy to reapply. Left my lips feeling nourished and not dried out. And the lip liners are one of the best on the market as they are super pigmented, long lasting and creamy. Definitely would repurchase",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good kit not so flattering
To start off the feel and wear time of the lip kit was great and I have no complaints there. The only thing is that on my skin tone this color reads a little 80s and it feels more like a costume lip color than an everyday wear. I'll probably buy this kit in another shade because I really do enjoy how it doesn't feel tight or drying on the lips.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"ok
I really liked it. It’s a semi matte . I just wouldn’t re-purchase it because I found out that semi mattes don’t fit my lifestyle",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"the color was what i thought
The product is great. But it’s more of a brownish bare not a peachy bare. Pictures don’t do it justice but I still love the product! I mixed the lip color with my peachy bear and absolutely loved the outcome. It lasted two whole days!

",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"bare
I received the Kylie Cosmetics Lip Kit in the color Bare, and it definitely lived up to its color name. I think a different color would have given me a better chance to review the kit, since it was hard to tell that I even had it on. The nude color blended right in t to my lip color. It was easy to apply and felt nice on my lips. I love that it wasn’t sticky. I just wish I could have seen it better so I knew how well it stayed on.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"it make my lips is dry
The packaging is so lovely. There was a faint vanilla scent when I opened the lipstick and applied it on my lips. I think my face skin doesn't like this color because it becomes more yellow when I applied it (I'm Asian), maybe this lipstick is suitable for those of people with lighter skin tone or makeup.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"really great red lip
I was a little hesitant to try this lip kit for a night out. I have a double lip line so I’m very loyal to my current red lipstick BUT this lip kit exceeded my expectations! It didn’t make my lips feel dry at all. In fact, I forgot I even had it on. The weight of it is comparable to the lime crime plushies (a liiiitle heavier than them) and the color lasts a long time - it didn’t even smudge after eating. I’d repurchase for sure!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"almost perfect!
I really loved how smooth both of these applied. I was most thrilled with the liner I would purchase many of them. My only issue with the lipstick is my lips did get a bit dry however the lip did last several hours which I appreciate",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great
I have seen the Kylie Jenner lip kits since 2016 but I have never purchased one myself. So I was super excited to try this product. I got it in the shade Posie K and the shade is amazing. I love that the kit comes ?with both a lip liner and the actual lipstick. I definitely will be using this in my makeup up routines.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great product, color a little weird
I think the lip kit is overall a great product. I love how it feels, how well it stays on, how the two products compliment each other. I just wasn’t a huge fan of the color.

",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"fermin’ fancy
Well. This was an exciting product to receive but it came at a time when I really didn’t need to wear a bright red fancy lip color to anything anytime soon. It took me awhile to actually try the product because of this. I mean, I could have put it on for work but that’s not a vibe I typically go for in the office or on Zoom calls. ",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"gorgeous!
Beautiful red color that lasted all day! I loved how smoothly it glided on and how easy it was to apply. Highly recommend! I also loved the packaging! Thank you Kylie cosmetics",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"makes my lips look super full
The biggest thing I noticed is that this product makes my lips look super full! The color I got didn’t look great in my skin but they have so many other selections that I’ll be trying them out again for sure! It also lasts all night which was great!

",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"it’s alright
I love the lip liner. The color is very vibrant and a good match with the lip color. Lip color is also velvety going on and color is super cut. But after it dries down my lips feel stiff and dry. And after removing it my lips are super dry, need tons of lip balms",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"moust pigmented lip kit
Such a liquid formula and the color is absolutely beautiful!!! love lipstick and lip products but am new to lipliner as I never know how to match shades. I'm so glad KYLIE has these liners and lipsticks! This liner is super easy to apply. Both products were pleasant to apply, they last long time and smells amazing. Definitely recommend to my friends.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good quality, color not for me
Honestly I would have loved this so much more if it was a different color. Didn’t love this color on me, but maybe could be fun for a night out. The quality of this lip kit surprised me! It stayed on alllll night, even after I had dinner. It did come off on my straw, but didn’t smear on my lips",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"nice lipstick
This lipstick is good, but not great. The color of the lipstick was beautiful. The formula is really good for application, with nice pigmentation. But when it dried, it felt a bit crumbly and uncomfortable, and felt like the coverage wouldn’t last long.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love the color!
I love the color Posie K. It is the perfect color for anyone’s lips. The formula is much better than it used to be but I would say it is a tiny bit drying. I would buy again though.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"nice!
This lip kit was very nice the color not so much not a big fan of pink lipstick. Other then the color the lip liner is so nice and smooth the application is amazing. The lipstick was also very nice to apply too.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love the formula, maybe a differnet shade
the velvet lip kits have SUCH a nice formula!! pros - goes on smooth, pigmented & doesn't feel drying at all!! cons - smudges kind of easily. this shade was a little too warm for me (i'm cool toned & the red velvet shade is a warm red, kind of red-orangey) but i think in a different shade, i'll love it! will probably be purchasing a cool toned lip kit soon :)",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"pretty good lip product
I was not a total fan of the color I received, but I think that is because it is pinker on me than I thought. I love the lip pencil though, and it will be a new staple of mine. The texture of the lipstick was odd, but other than that, I would give it a 7/10. It wore well during the day but I had to reapply once",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"get it!!
I love this lip kit! It’s so smooth, it lasts all day, it doesn’t smudge.. i don’t know what else you need. And the best part it comes in a variety of colors.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"vibrant color
The color was really bright and vibrant. The color I was sent wasn't my typical color as it was a super bright pink. It went on easy and lasted a long time",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love this shade, mauvey but more of a pink shade!
Good product and the price is reasonable compared to others!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"mixed
I only gave this a 4 star because I absolutely loved the liquid lipstick in this duo. I did not like the lip liner, as it was too hard to put on and then even here to take off. I prefer creamy lip liners, but if you want something that will stay all day then this will definitely do that.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love the color
This is a very vibrant pink and I love it! It stayed on and the color was beautiful. I will definitely be trying more colors in the future.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"perfect red in time for vday
Directions say to fill in your lips with the lip liner and then do one coat of the liquid lipstick. The lip liner is super creamy and easy to apply. The lipstick smells like vanilla and also applies nicely. It is a matte finish but not too drying. It is not transfer proof from my experience. Beautiful true red shade

",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"cutesy lil set
The Kylie lip kit is truly iconic at this point, this formula is much less matte than the original and feels very comfortable on the lips. While it isn’t as long wearing, I feel like these velvet lipsticks feel more modern as the super matte lips have become a bit outdated now and glossier lips are back in.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"really great product!
Overall I really liked this product! It stayed on relatively well, I will say it didn’t fully make it through a sandwich (that could’ve slightly been user error though). It was the perfect color for me and went on really easily! Good product",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great color, but…
First time trying Kylie’s product. The pencil is soft, it’s great, I like it. The lipstick is beautiful but too liquid, and I’d say a little uneven application. But the color is perfect!!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"velvety and smooth, super on-brand
Okay so I loved the feel and the doe foot applicator to the lipgloss. It goes on wet and doesn't dry to fast but when it does, it has about a 3/10 transfer. It isn't completely transfer proof but it literally felt like I was wearing nothing. Lightweight and such a good formula.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good but not my shade!
The formula of both products are nice - velvety and comfortable! Sadly the shade Harmony was just not complimentary on my olive skin that I couldn’t enjoy the product enough to wear it and test the longevity and wear quality. The initial application was really nice though which is why I’m giving it 4 stars.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"buttery
This is my first Kylie product and I was excited to try it. The color on my skin definitely needs to be used with a darker color because it’s quite light for my skin tone. ",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"pleased
I have purchased Lip Kits and the past and I am a fan of them. I have no real complaints other than the price point ( a little too expensive in my opinion) and also the lip liner has a tendency to fall out of the actual pencil. But other than it is worth a try",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good texture
I like how the lipstick feels on the lips, it’s very thin yet ultra pigmented. The lip pencil is very soft. I would chose a different color next time because for me it’s a little to light, I like darker color personality.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great color payoff
I was surprised but how bright and long lasting this color was on my lips. I especially liked that it included both the lip liner and matching lipstick for a perfect match. However it was a little too bright for my taste, brighter than I anticipated after seeing the photo online",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great lip liner, average lipstick
The shade bare is a very pale nude and although I love nudes, this would not be my goto on my beige skin. That being said, the lip liner is a product I would purchase separately. ",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love it!!! just not as an everyday wear.
I was really satisfied with the color I chose, it looks great against deeper toned skin. My only thing is I like more of a glossy lip look and of course It’s going to be a little drying because it’s a velvet lip kit, but overall I really liked the product.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"okay
So I always wanted to try this since I was young but heard so many mixed reviews . My personal opinion is that the color is pretty even the other shades and the lip liner is creamy but the formula was velvet yet did not dry like others . I wouldn't ever get any Kylie kits myself.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"it’s a good product
I love this shade it’s beautiful for a nude, it stays for the majority of the day but does leave my lips a little dry, but just throw some gloss overtop and it’s perfect!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"surprising
I didn’t expect much from this because I am not really into this brand - but it got surprisingly pleased. The color pops just the right amount and it is long lasting. I am overall satisfied!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"feels light and smooth
I was unsure about how I would like this since I’m not usually big on lip makeup, however I was surprised on how smooth this way. I used very little and spread it out. Since I didn’t do a thick layer it felt nice and light, but I can see it still feeling that away if I did do a full “sweep”.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love it
I was soooo excited to try this product and it did not disappoint . I've never tried Kyle cosmetics products before and I'm pleasantly surprised! I want to buy more. Harmony is a fun, pink color. Honestly it’s a perfect nude shade for me. the lipliner is smooth and glides on with ease. It’s doesn’t dry out the lips like others I have tried.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"so-so
The color was okay. The lipliner held up and I did like how it looked still after the day end but wasn’t a huge fan of the liquid lipstick. It was incredibly drying and I tried many different things, exfoliating before etc. and hydrating but each time it would dry down and it would make my lips look incredibly dry by day end. So I would rate this an okay product but nothing revolutionary. Also maybe a different color would’ve looked better on my complexion.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"say no more lip kit
This lip kit is so good. The lip pencil just glides on your lips and the lip gloss? feels so nice on. I didn’t think I would get a Kylie product but I loved it. Such great quality.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"lip kit review
I loved the color! The lip pencil is super creamy. Only downside is that when I ate the lipstick came off, they’re not super long lasting.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"kylie lip kit - bare
I received the Kylie Velvet Lip Kit in the shade Bare. The color & packaging are beautiful. The product itself is long lasting & easy to apply, but I’m not the biggest fan of a velvet finish. Other than that, I think it’s great!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love the duo
I’ve been wanting to try this lip kit for years now because of the hype. I was surprised when I actually tried it. I really like the lip liner and lipstick duo. The liner really makes the lipstick pop. I love the harmony color! I would get other colors too.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i wanted to dislike this, but i couldn’t
I was really surprised I was chosen to review any Kylie lip kit because her brand has never been a favorite of mine. Maybe it is because I’m old, but I was ready to dislike this lipstick. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it! The smell is really nice and it goes on very creamy. I like the stained look, so I just wiped off the excess and was ready to go. I also never used to use lipliners but this liner made my skin pop!

",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"it’s good
I have used the Kylie lip kits when they first became viral but never used the velvet finish. I enjoy the formula a lot, it smells good but I don’t like that you have to sharpen the lip liner. I wish it was twistable so that the packaging didn’t get ruined.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"different formula?
Happy that a lip liner and liquid lipstick were both sent to test it out. Although it was a color I wouldn’t traditionally wear (Barbie pink) the formula, especially lip liner, felt really smooth. Wish the liquid lipstick lasted longer.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"really enjoyed!
This lip kit was great! The liner went in perfectly and the lipstick was smooth and applied well. It was velvety and lasted a while which I like! My lips were slightly stained so luckily I have been careful when applying so that it didn’t stain my face. The color was a little out of my comfort zone, as I normally go for a nude color, but I liked the formula! I definitely can see myself buying a different color in the future. Recommend giving it a try!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"decent lip kit
I got the color “posie k” and liked the color. The lip pen is really long lasting and doesn’t transfer, I tested on my wrist and it was still there at the end of the day. The lip kit in general was a little drying when I tried on my lips but I think that can be solved if you put on lip balm ahead of time. It’s decent but probably not something I would go out of my way to purchase on my own.

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"velvet lip kit
This liquid lipstick and lip liner are the perfect duo. This lip is Demi matte. Long wearing, quick drying when applied thin. Beautiful bright red color payoff.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great lip product!
I really liked the texture of the lip liner and lipstick! The only thing was the color I was sent was too light for me. I did like this product though, and would potentially be interested in purchasing a different shade.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"not bad
I was actually expecting a bright, blue toned red but this lipstick was definitely more of an orangey red. That being said, this was a beautiful lipstick with a good formula that didn’t streak or dry out my lips too much.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"kylie cosmetics velvet lip kit
I absolutely love this lip kit. The color is pigment and it feels great on my lips. It’s long lasting I would definitely recommend this product to others.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"glad i tried it!
I have never tried any products from this brand and always thought it was all hype. But it’s actually pretty good! The color I got was a pretty close match to my natural lip color so it gave a my lips but better feel. The pencil is long lasting and actually stayed better than another lip pencil I own when I swatched both in my and did a rub test. The actual lip velvet was nice too but I prefer a shiny/glossy lip over anything matte/velvet. I will say it did not dry out my lips which was nice.

",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"pretty good lip kit
I wasn’t sure how I would like this lip kit because I’ve heard mixed reviews. I love the liner so much because it goes on soo smoothly and is a great color. The liquid lipstick is a little harder to apply. I felt like I had to apply enough to not have missing spots but then it felt like a lot of liquid on my lips. Overall, I would recommend!!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"lovely color!
Received this Kylie lip kit complimentary from Influenster in exchange of my honest opinion. I’d like to start off by saying - I love this color! I’m a sucker for reds and can honestly be the only shade I’m ever able to pull off lol.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love it
I love how vibrant this lip kit looks it such. A bright pink color if u like bright pinks this one you will like this one is more of a velvety lip stick. Vs the matte my lips feel hydrated as-well. It is also smudged proof which I like. Very cute lip kit I highly recommend it",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"feels great
I love love love the formula of this liquid lipstick and the lip liner is so creamy and smooth! While I’m not a huge fan of the shade I received, I can say that it felt amazing on my lips and the wear test went pretty good. I give it a solid 4 out of 5!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"super smooth!
I’ve been really excited to try this lip kit, I have purchased her lip kits in the past. The lip liner is absolutely wonderful. It’s one of the smoothest lip liners I have ever used as I applied it to my lips. The lipstick was also amazing, great coverage and application. I only deducted a star because the color did not suit my skin tone well. But I would absolutely purchase other other colors!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love a good lippy
I’ve always wanted to try the Kylie lip products, but haven’t because I didn’t feel like spending what they cost. I was thrilled to be selected by influenster to give an honest review on them! First, I love the color, it’s pretty and neutral. The application is very smooth and it lasts. It does however transfer very easily which stinks. Overall though, its a solid lippy and I would buy it.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good texture color slightly off
The texture of the liquid lipstick was good and smooth. The lipliner was basic. The coloring was bright but slightly off. It should have been either a bit more neon pink or a bit more rose. Just could have been a better color but the formula was good.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"fun color
I love the color of this product and that it has a matte finish. I also love that it has an exact match liner with it. The lipstick isn't as long wearing as I would prefer. It isn't sticky at all and wears more like a matte finish.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"creamy
I actually really liked this product. I got the PERFECT shade harmony and it looks cute on my tan complexion. I love how creamy it is and how it comes in a set with the lipstick and lipliner. Kylie ate with this formula and I appreciate influencster letting me try this product.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"like but not love
I do like the variety of shades and how the kit is a liner and liquid lip but I’m not the biggest fan of matte lipsticks - they dry up too fast on my lips . The shade I got was really pretty though",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great application but not sure about the color…
I love how easily it applies, but the color is not very compatible on darker lips/ tan skin tone… I felt like a clown. But that’s just my opinion— the actually product glides well and lasted for a few hours without reapplication",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"not my color but beautiful product!
Thank you kyliecosmetics and Influenster for allowing me to try out the famous lip kit! I love the lip liner and liquid lipstick duo, this is definitely not a flattering color on me but the product is high quality and surprisingly stays on all day!",kylie cosmetics,neutral
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great lip product
I’ll preface this by saying I don’t wear lipstick often, lol. This color is a perfect match for my natural lips and I use it mainly as a base layer covered by a tinted gloss. Went on smooth and didn’t dry my lips out.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"durable
The color is not my favorite for my skyn tone. Maybe it will be better for white people . I like the color stay for a really long time, even when it transfer a lot, unlike the matte ones.",kylie cosmetics,positive

I have to admit that the Kylie lip kit was cuter than expected. The lip liner and matte lipstick was very flattering and lasted a long time. I do like the matte look as well.",kylie cosmetics,positive

I've never used Kylie Cosmetics before so I was pretty pumped when I was chosen for this campaign. The good stuff: the formula for the lip liner was smooth and glided very well when I put it on.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"nice duo
The Charm color is a little light for my skin tone (fair) but the quality of product is nice. The lipliner pairs well with the lip product, both are long lasting. The lip stain has a slight vanilla scent which I haven’t noticed in other Kylie lip kit sets!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"beautiful formula
I really like the formula of the lip liner and the velvet lip. It is long lasting without being drying. I tried Posie K and I do think it comes off way more pink than the swatches showed. So for that reason I’d be more likely to try a different color in the future and would love more neutral/rose options.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good product
Application was easy and looked nice on. I don’t think the color was right for my skin tone but still a nice shade. It was the first Kylie product I’ve tried and was pleasantly surprised.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good, but not my absolute fav
The color was beautiful! Very understated nude, perfect for an everyday look. I love Kylie lip kits, but I much prefer the matte lipsticks over the velvet. I just feel like the matte ones last so much longer and don’t show as much wear throughout the day.

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"incredible product, wrong color
For starters, I loved the quality of this duo. Application was super easy, and the texture/feeling is best described by the products’ name: velvety.",kylie cosmetics,positive

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"matte
This is a great lippie if you are looking for a matte lipstick. I wish it matched my lips more, it is more redder than it looks in the pics but still pretty. The matte isn’t over drying and it looks pretty",kylie cosmetics,positive

These products are super pigmented and bright! The liner is lush and rich, and the lipstick is a bit sticky but has a nice finish and a buildable formula. Not sure about the transfer/staying power, yet.",kylie cosmetics,positive

I don’t really prefer matte finishes for my lip products, but this product works well for what it is. It stays on pretty long but the only issue I would say is that it doesn’t really match the color shown online.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"beautiful color
The color I received was beautiful. However, I wish the product stuck onto my lips more longer. It started coming off pretty early in the evening and my lips did get pretty dry. I usually prep my lips before putting product on it so I was surprised how quick it made my lips dry. Overall the product is okay.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"pigmented!
Very pigmented lip kit. The liner was easy to use and blends easily. The color was not streaky or patchy. Overall good lip products! I prefer moisturizing lip products and these were a bit dry for my taste but I can see others enjoying this.",kylie cosmetics,positive

I am very impressed by the boldness of the color. It completely covers my original lip color. Also the color stays on really well. Once it dries, it almost doesn't wear off at all.",kylie cosmetics,negative

The lipstick is a bit brighter than expected but lays well on the lips still a bit on the dries side even though it it a velvet formula.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i like it
This lip kit applied really nicely and smoothly and didn't accentuate my dry lips which was great but i wasn't a huge fan of the color on me. Would love to try other colors in the future though and the packaging was cute. Not transfer proof but I didn't mind that but be aware if that matters for you",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"say no more
I gave it a 4/5 because the color is not for me. It's way too bright. Not as bright as I thought it would be. Good quality otherwise. Not sticky. No scent. Great color coverage. I'd be interested in a more neutral color. Thankyou",kylie cosmetics,positive

The Kylie Cosmetics Velvet Lip Kit in the shade Harmony overall was pretty nice quality.

I found this lip kit to be a bit drying for lips, so I didn’t love how it looked a few hours after application. The shade is definitely fun and adventurous so the drying could be fixed by adding a gloss over it. But I personally won’t be wearing it on its own next time. It is lost-lasting which is nice!",kylie cosmetics,positive

Theres nothing that really stands out about this product to me. The lip liner is extremely creamy which contrasts the liquid matte lipstick in a weird way. I would not pair this together.

The lip liner is very soft and velvety, it does not match the liquid lip 100% but it is close. There is a slight scent to the lipstick that is not offensive. The packaging feels cheap to me.

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"pretty, but drying!
Upon first application, I LOVED this lip set. The color is pretty, it smells like cake, and it was really comfortable for the first hour or so.

I did get 9+ hours of wear out of this product, and the lip liner is really nice, but I have other liquid lipsticks that are more comfortable to wear.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"nice product, meh color
The products itself performed well. The lip liner is long lasting and the velvet liquid lipstick has good pigmentation and feels comfortable on the lips. My only gripe is the color leans too warm pink and does not look good with my skin complexion. I’d probably use the lip liner but the liquid lipstick isn’t flattering.",kylie cosmetics,positive

I SO badly wanted to fall in love with this. So very badly. I absolutely love the color! The lip liner glides on like silk and is just flawless.

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"feels nice at first but not for long wear
This was a really nice lip duo! The liquid lipstick was very pigmented and went on smoothly without feeling tacky/drying at the beginning leaving a nice shine, but after a few hours wear it did start to loose the smooth look and dried out. If you’re wearing this over a long period of time, I would put on a slightly thinner layer",kylie cosmetics,neutral

I prefer this velvet formula over the original matte formula from years ago because it looks better on the lips.

I received this product for free to test. Went on pretty smooth, and was a pretty color, but did not last at all, even with setting powder applied over the lip liner.",kylie cosmetics,negative
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great color
Color payoff was very good. Can never go wrong with a classic red. Creamy consistency but longevity wasn't there for me. Transferred pretty easily even after letting it dry.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"not impressed
I tried this on alone & wore for maybe 3 hours & I didn’t like it alone . it didn’t last as long as I thought . Although the finish of the lip product is nice and didn’t dry my lips out . I ended up using it as a topper with brown lip liner and gloss .",kylie cosmetics,neutral
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good, not great
I really wanted to like the Kylie lip kit. I used the product several times before coming to a conclusion. The shade is really nice and subtle. However, I didn’t like the application. It went on almost splotchy and didn’t look smooth. I would definitely recommend the lip liner.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"not my favorite
I receive the 700 bare velvet color, but isn’t my favorite nude color because is too light for my skin tone, I have another favorite nude lipsticks but this is not good for me. I like the lip liner because is indelible.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"not good for dry lips
it was very dry and patchy. better to use just the liner with gloss of your lips are more chapped. other than that it’s amazing",kylie cosmetics,neutral
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"not that good
I was really looking forward to trying this to see if it actually worked, and it does make your lips look bigger. Sadly, I did not feel very comfortable using it, because it is pretty dry. I don’t think I would purchase it.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"didn’t like the shade
Personally the color was too pink for me and not applicable for brown skin. I was excited for getting this product but the shade was not it for me.",kylie cosmetics,negative
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"looks good
I liked the product however the color I received was not as shown in the pictures. It went in smooth and didn’t feel dry.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"disappointed
Honestly I had such high expectations for these products. While the lip liner itself is decent (applies smoothly & is creamy) I didn’t really care for the lipstick. I know it’s supposed to be matte-ish but I found it to be very drying",kylie cosmetics,neutral
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"not the best match!
My main complaint is that the lip liner and liquid lip do not match. They are completely different tones/shades. They don’t compliment each other in my opinion. With that being said I like the lip liner formula. It’s creamy without being too soft. The liquid lip is nice as well; it’s not completely matte which I enjoy. I would use these two products separately as opposed to in a kit.",kylie cosmetics,neutral
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"like the velvet formula
I was glad to receive the Bare Velvet formula lip kit, but was disappointed in the lip liner color. The liner seems to dark to match the color lipstick. I did however enjoy both formulas",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"looked ashy on my skintone
This color is supposed to be a nude, but it isn’t a nude on my skintone (Light-Medium). The lipliner is very soft so you have to draw it on very gently or the product gets a little smooshed and extra product comes off. The liquid lipstick is a little drying and flaky and emphasizes any lip texture dramatically. I’m not really a fan as this shade pulls grey and ashy on me rather than being a cute nude pink but perhaps I would like it more in a different shade. Quality is so-so to me. I wouldn’t personally recommend.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"kylie cosmetics
I loved the texture and the packaging. However, it was not a color that suited my skin color. The product itself was nice and velvety and dried really nicely. The lip liner was creamy and not dry, as well as easy to trace your lips with. Really good quality

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"underwhelmed
I had high hopes for this, based on all the hype I'd heard. But I'm really picky about lip products, and pickier about colour. ",kylie cosmetics,positive

This is my first time using Kylie cosmetics and I’m happy to be trying the famous lip kit. I think that it’s an amazing idea that the kit comes with the lip liner and the lip stick, not many brands do that. On to the review, I love the liner. It glides on my lips easily and is very pigmented.",kylie cosmetics,neutral

I never really tried kylie lip kits but this formula is very buttery and easy to apply! Sadly this shade did not suit me very well.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"not great
I remember getting the Kylie lip kit?s back in 2015 when everyone was raving about them and I hated the formula so when I got this vox box I was really hoping that the formulas have gotten better and i will admit they have slightly gotten better but I still don’t like them. ",kylie cosmetics,negative
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"pretty
I’m super happy with this color, it’s pink but not dramatic, so it’s easy to wear with anything. The lip liner applies effortlessly and stays on super well! I had a hard time taking this off. I’m not a big fan of “velvet” lip sticks, which is why I gave it 3 stars. I suffer from chronic chapped lips so this really highlighted my insecurities, but I topped it with a lip gloss which helped.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"just okay
The color- I love. The liner, I love. The actual lip color though? Not my favorite. It doesn't look velvet but rather my lips looked like I hadn't used any chapstick in 20 years. It did stay on well bit I didn't like the finish enough to really test it out",kylie cosmetics,neutral
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"nice color, but looks dry
I like how the product applied and I liked the color. However, it made my lips look really dry. I didn’t wear it for the day so I can’t say how long it lasts.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"too cool for yellow undertone
I wasn't really a fan of the color because I have yellow undertones and this shade of pink is too cool. I also don't really wear neon bright colors. It's too much for me. The formulation is decent. I love that it also comes with a lip liner. Overall, it was okay. Better if you like neon colors and have a cooler skin tone.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"more pink than you think
this is like the perfect pinky nude. lip liner is super creamy and easy to apply. the lipstick formula sits nicely on the lips. do recommend prepping your lips prior so they don’t dry out. the only reason i gave it a 3 is because it is slightly to pink for me so it’s just not an everyday go to for me",kylie cosmetics,neutral
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"colors not brown girl friendly!
I got this product for free from influenster in exchange for an honest review. I like the formula, especially when so many liquid lipsticks can be so drying. This one definitely feels very comfortable and moisturizing on lips. But the colors... they're definitely made only for those with fair skin. I thought red, out of all others, would be most suitable for a darker skin tone but I was wrong. It's too orange. If this brand wants to include everyone, they should definitely looks for more universally matching hues (Ruby Woo by Mac is a great place to start). Should've given it 2 stars but I'll make it 3 because I genuinely like the formula, but please make better colors!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"not my color
I don’t like this color. I’m more red, burgundy, darker shades. I also don’t know how to use the lip liner. The tip broke on the lip liner when I tried to use it.",kylie cosmetics,negative
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"posie k
The lipliner is super long lasting and doesn’t smudge . The lipstick itself is slightly drying but I also prefer a non matte formula in general. It’s not a bad product but it’s not a color or formula i would’ve chosen myself",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"ok… not great but not horrible
I was really excited to get this KYLIE LIP KIT in the color poise K. I can’t say I love it but I also can’t say I hate it. There are plenty of other better quality lip products in my opinion for equal or better value. While I did like the color because I typically opt for mauves, it was just a bit too pink for me.",kylie cosmetics,neutral

The color is nice but I do not think it suits my skin tone. If anything it makes my skin look bland. It’s not a drying lipstick and feels super soft though",kylie cosmetics,negative

I was very disappointed in this product. The lip liner was okay and applied fine, but the liquid lipstick was a bit much. It is very pigmented and easily stains your skin. It also dried very quickly and made the stain look uneven in color. Overall, would not recommend",kylie cosmetics,negative

Smooth application. I can tell it lasts & is great quality. Definitely not my color. In my opinion, pinks look great on paler skin but for my complexion, I’ll stick to nudes and browns",kylie cosmetics,positive

For how expensive this lip kit runs for, I would consider it drugstore quality. It seems like you pay for the name and that’s it. It’s pretty drying and does not stick around long at all.

The color is beautiful, but it is just not flattering on my skin tone, maybe if I had a medium or deeper skin tone I think it would work.

Miss Kylie has got an absolute hit on her hands with this formula!!!! Not only is the color of this lip kit so universally flattering, but also the formula itself is SO COMFORTABLE. If you’re an OG Kylie lipkits follower, you know how her mattes can feel somewhat dry and emphasize lip lines - but not the velvet series. Now, this formula is far from transferproof but it does have good staying power (I didn’t feel like I had to reapply after eating). Honestly, I’d gladly buy more colors in this lip kit formula.",kylie cosmetics,positive

I have never tried anything from Kylie other than one of her highlighters I got as a gift one year. I liked the highlighter but it wasn’t anything special or different from so many others. So I was just never interested in trying anything else from her line. I have to say I was so surprised when I tried this. I loved it right away. The liner is a slightly different shade from the lipstick but it looks so nice layered. I was really surprised how long the lipstick lasted because it’s not a true liquid lipstick that dries matte. I will definitely be getting some more colors and I highly recommend!",kylie cosmetics,positive

I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review from Influenster and Kylie Cosmetics. At first when I tried on i wasn’t wearing makeup and my lips looked pale. I wasn’t too sure if I liked it because the color is more on the pink side and I use a bit darker color since my skin complex is darker. Got ready and tried it on and I love it. My sister told me this color looks nice too. It does lasts hours so I’m very happy and I will sure buy another color other than this",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"The perfect formula
This was my first time trying Kylie Cosmetics, and her lip kit did not disappoint. As the product description says, the formula is highly pigmented and glides on effortlessly. This liquid demi-matte lipstick is truly the first of its kind. It has a non-drying texture which makes it incredibly comfortable to wear. It also has a subtle scrumptious vanilla scent. Of course with all of these great features, the kit retails at $32, which is on the higher end for lip kits.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love it
I was a little hesitant as if I would like this color and formula, but I actually loved it! It was so smooth & the color was perfect.

I love this formula so much better than the matte! The matte would dry out my lips but this one does not and it stays on forever. I’m switching to velvet instead of matte! And I love the bold red color, it fits so well with my dark skin tone",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"loved it!!
Loved this product. I always wanted to try it but I had never bought it and now thanks to influenster I found my favorite lip kit. It lasts all day on the lips, it's comfortable and the color I got was beautiful. I love and recommend this product!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"pretty
This is a pretty lipstick and goes on smoothly. Doesn't feel too drying. It's a little pink for my personal taste but still looks nice, I think. I will almost definitely use it on occasion.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great duo
The Kylie Cosmetics Velvet Lip Kit is a great duo of liquid lipstick and lip liner. I loved the color, Posie K, which has a nice dusty rose pink color. The liner applies smoothly and evenly. The liquid lipstick also goes on smooth and then dries into a nice matte finish, lasting well.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"bold lip
Wasn't sure if I would like the bright barbie color, but I actually do. It's a fun shade even compared to my fair complexion. Smooth to apply and I only needed one coat. Dried quickly but doesn't dry out your lips. Long lasting, it was several hours before I had to reapply (mind you that's with eating and drinking in that time).",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love
I’ve been trying this product for a few weeks and I really love it. I love the color not very out there and I really like the semi-matte application. It feels really smooth on my lips and being sort of Matte effect it does not dry up my lips",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"say no more
I can’t say I love the color, but the quality is exemplary. Durable, it stays on! Wish it was of every day/event color. Smooth application.",kylie cosmetics,netural
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"beautiful and comfortable!
I used to be obsessed with Kylie lip kits when I was young. It has been a while since I last tried a Kylie lip kit. It’s my first time trying a velvet lip kit, and I really enjoyed it. Matching lip pencil makes everything so much easier. This product is very comfortable on the lips because it is velvet. I have nothing bad to say about it because I love velvet lipsticks and glosses more than a Matte lip especially in the winter time. Give these a try and you won’t regret it!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"best cheer competition red lips!
We love the red velvet lip kit and recommend it to our entire team and other cheerleaders! It goes on smooth, stays on through competitions and awards and looks amazing on stage! Simply the best red out there!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i actually really loved this lipstick formula! eve
Even though I’ve never tried lipstick formula I’m already obsessed !Surprise surprise! It’s very long lasting and dint dry my lips at all!! I’m thinking about getting a nude color lipstick in liquid form. Love this stuff already! And definitely would recommend it to my girlfriends! Definitely don’t sleep on her lipsticks as they are actually really good for what you are paying! P.S the lip pencil didn’t even budge when I apply it in the morning????",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"Beautiful color that lasts.
I was honestly surprised by how pretty the color was! It's highly pigmented and feels very soft on your lips. So far, I've had it last a few hours without touchups.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"posit k velvet
I really liked the formula of this lippie , very comfortable and pigmented . It lasted long too I really like this formula of hers !",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"a kylie lip kit never fails!
You can always rely on your Kylie lip kit to get you through any event- no matter the duration! It stays ON. I wouldn’t say I am in love with this color, but for the right event, it can be fun! I opted to use this color on New Year’s Eve for a fun pop!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"perfect for valentines ??
Is was very creamy to apply with the lip liner only not so easy to clean when sharpening it ! And the velvet lipstick was very hydrated for my lips and gave me a beautiful old Hollywood look I definitely will be using it often since the red is my fav color",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great nude that enhances lips
This product really does what it claims, enhances lip size with the two products. It’s a matte product, so just make sure you moisturize your lips prior to use for best results.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"kylie cosmetics are back
I honestly haven’t even seen a Kylie lip product since high school so I was really excited to receive this product and see how their products have evolved. I was pleasantly surprised with the high quality and smooth application!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"loved the formula !!
The shade is too light for my skin tone which definitely surprised me, I thought it would be darker looking at the tube. Anyway, the formula is heavenly! No drying out or transferring and it’s perfectly pigmented. I’ll be trying different shades soon !!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"so pretty
I’m glad I got this shade. It’s so cute & pretty! The lip liner glides on so easily and the velvet lip feels nice. This is also my first time trying Kylie cosmetics. I’m a fan now.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love it
fascinated with these lipsticks, my lips feel super soft!! The smell is rich, it does not feel heavy in the mouth! I really loved it",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love it!!!!
really impressed with the lipsticks! I love the aroma and the pencil is too creamy! my lips look great",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great product
Looks really nice and feels nice and creamy on lips. So pleased!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"posie k
Loveee this color! I always wanted to try it out but never got the chance to until now. Thank you influenster! Definitely worth the hype! It lasts long and not drying.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love this lip kit
This is my first time trying out a Kylie lip kit and it was a great experience! The lip liner blends well with the lipstick and it looks great. It is also long lasting and easy to blend. Once it dries it stays on the lips for hours. It also feels velvety and comfortable on the lips.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"soft matte
Smells like buttercream, pigmented, and a soft matte finish. I really love this and I didn’t think I would. It has a beautiful finish that looks good even with dry lips in the winter. It’s not transfer proof, but it does last a long time. It wears down gracefully and doesn’t just disappear when you eat something. Feels good on the lips too. I recommend this if you see a color you like! I like the lip pencil a little more than the cream because the pencil is even more matte than the cream, but together it’s a winner!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"kylie for the win!
Absolutely adored this color and lip kit. This is the bare velvet. Such a perfect nude color with just enough tint of color. It is not permanent and does wipe off with normal wear but I only have to reapply maybe 2-3x a day. Love this kit so so much! Thank you for the opportunity to try!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"posie k color - must have
This lipstick set is beautiful. Nice packaging. The lip liner is so smooth and soft. The liquid lipstick color is great too but after awhile it feel a bit dry. Remember to exfoliate and hydrate your lips before applying liquid lipsticks. Thank you so much Kylie Cosmetic & Influenster ??",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"harmony
Harmony is a nice shade a pink that I really like. The lip liner was smooth to put on and easy to apply! I like how the lip gloss was glossy when applying then became a nice matte color when dried!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love it
i never tried Kylie cosmetics before and i know understand why it is so good and everyone is talking how soft and great it is. I am loving this color and would possibly use it every few days to look great with light makeup on",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"so smooth!
Love the way the pencil applies to the lips, very smooth and silky?? I feel like when you want to dress it down the pencil alone even would be enough. The lipstick also applies nicely, a little can go a long way. It dries quickly and stays on a while!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"new favorite!
I am so in love with this lip kit! The shade is absolutely beautiful and so pigmented and the scent is subtle but delicious. So creamy, goes on perfect, and is definitely my new favorite",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great!
I got the shade harmony which is a very pretty pink color. The texture of the lipstick is very smooth and creamy which makes it a good option for those of us who like to wear lipstick all day without having that dry, crusty feeling on the lips. Definitely recommend!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"long lasting
This is my first time trying out a Kylie lip kit, and it didn’t disappoint! At first, the lip liner seemed super bright when I applied it, but it blended in well with the lipstick and looked great! It was long lasting and easy to blend while wet. Once it dries, then it’s stuck on your lips. It did come off after I had dinner, but I’m still satisfied with this product.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"pleasantly surprised!!
This lip kit is amazing! The pencil is smooth and very well pigmented, so it the lipstick. It stays fairly well while you eat or drink as long as you're not eating anything too messy/wet. Definitely recommend bringing the kit with you if you're going out so you can reapply if needed. I prefer this product to ones that claim to be ""all day"" or ""smudge-proof/life-proof"" because this did NOT dry my lips out after wearing for hours. The shade was super cute and flattering too!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"a happy first!
This was my first time trying anything from Kylie Cosmetics. I feel I lucked out a bit with the shade, I would honestly be too scared to purchase most of the shades blindly without being able to see them in person first. Like some reviewers, I do agree the liquid lip formula is drying, but I have yet to try a liquid lip from any brand that isn’t drying. Considering the lovely velvet finish, the smooth result I got from pairing it with the lip liner, and the fact that I wouldn’t be wearing this color all day long anyway, I think this kit is a pretty perfect version of what it is",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"bright and stayed all day!
I loved this kylie lip kit. The pink is BRIGHT, which I love. I put it on in the morning and it stayed put for at least 10 hours with eating and drinking. I will forever buy the kylie lip kits!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love it!
I was a bit skeptical of this color at first but I ended up loving it. I like that it comes with the liner and gloss. You def need to use both of them for the longest wear. It lasted hours even through drinking. I can’t wait to try more colors!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love it
This is my first time ever trying a Kylie lip kit and now it won’t be my last. I LOVED it, so creamy and went on really smooth. The colors were perfect together and literally such a great shade for me. The formula wasn’t clumpy or too drying. The packaging is iconic and I’m super happy, I’ll be recommending and purchasing for sure",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love
I love this lipliner/liquid lipstick combo! It went on smoothly and stayed. My lips did look and feel velvety. The color was a little bright for my liking but I was able to blot it down.",kylie cosmetics,positive

I really enjoyed the lipstick, it’s staying on your lips for a long time. The texture is amazing and it’s looking great!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"Lips
I really like Kylie cosmetics and that fact it comes with the lip liner. But this color was a little too pink for me I like more darker lipstick but it was a easy fix I just added a darker purple to it and it came out very nice. I would definitely be getting more colors of this brand.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"awesome lip combo
I really liked this lip combo! It’s the perfect pink for me! And the liner really is so smooth. It just glides on perfectly!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i received compliments all day
I received a little kid at no charge to me. I was skeptical of the color however I received compliments the entire day. The applicator goes on smooth it does not dry your lips or pill the color last all day. I would definitely recommend this look at and I will be trying other things thank you and for monster for sending me the vox",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"lip color
I do love the liner. The lip color seems like more of a stain to me. Was much more bright then I anticipated.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"one of my favorites
This lip liner especially was amazing. It went on so smooth and lasted for hours even with eating/drinking. The shade was the perfect nude for my skin tone. I also loved the velvet liquid lip, if complimented the liner perfectly and felt so comfortable on my lips.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"perfect pout
The new formula is incredible. This product provides the perfect pout and glides on like a dream without any stickiness or dryness.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"say no more - my new favorite pink!
I was a little afraid of the color at first for this Kylie lip kit, but it is amazing! I wore it to dinner and got so many compliments on how vibrant it is. It stayed on all night with no smudging through drinks, dinner, and a few hours of hanging out after. The only con is that it dries your lips a little which is normal for a matte product, so moisturizing before is a must. Loved this one!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"the perfect red!
I loved this velvet lip kit so much. I have one of her mattes and it’s a bit too drying but her velvet formula is spot on. I got red velvet and it’s the perfect red. 10/10 would recommend.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"run don’t walk to purchase this
i am OBSESSEDDDDD with this lip kit. the packaging, the pigmentation, the formula, all of it is perfect. i love red lipstick but sometimes it’s hard to find a liquid red lipstick that doesn’t bleed all over the place and stays on. this kylie lip kit is perfect. it goes on smooth, lasts for quite a while, and is not super messy to put on. definitely making this a go-to red lipstick.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love this shade
At first I thought it was way to bold of a color but when I put it on it looked absolutely amazing!! You only need a little bit!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"english/irish girl
Beautiful colour especially for fair skinned like me",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i do like the combo
The Kylie lip kit is smooth and waxy at the same time. I like the lip liner a lot but I’m not a big fan of the color. The lip liner compliments the lipstick very well!",kylie cosmetics,positive

Love the color. So bright & perfect for summers and four night outs. Changes the entire look of a simple outfit. Love the texture.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"kylie’s lipstick duo
This was my first time trying a Kylie lip kit. I’ve never used lip liner before, but the liner in the Kylie lip kit goes on so smoothly! And the color stays on for a while and doesn’t dry out your lips. It’s easy to use.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i loved it!
First of all I love how smooth is the application! Both the lip liner and the lipstick ?? Smell really good, I don’t feel my lips sticky or cracked after a couple of hours using them. I don’t usually use pink lipstick because I thing it doesn’t look nice on me but this one absolutely changed my mind!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good value
Love that this set comes with a lipstick and a lip liner - Greta value for the money that it is on the market for - would recommend",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i love the texture
This goes on very smooth and matte. I like how it doesn’t feel over drying once you apply it like other matte lipsticks. This color on darker skin just doesn’t look good though.

",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"perfect red pop!
I love Kylie lip kits, and this color is no exception. The red color was perfect for a fun night out. The matching lip liner made it easy to apply, and the pigment was long-lasting. It even stayed on through dinner and drinks.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"obsessed
I am OBSESSED with this kit! I am not a “bright” lip color kinda gal, but I received the Say No More shade and I love it! Both the liner and the lipstick go on so incredibly smooth and the color is so fun! I’m so obsessed I’m going to go get another shade for everyday wear. Then I’ll have a night out shade and an everyday shade. Thank you!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"so creamy and smooth!
Loving this Kylie Lip Kit! This is my first one and I’m impressed! The lip liner glides on so effortlessly as does the lipstick. The color Charm is a perfect nude and looks so natural. Really love this product, would purchase in the future!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love the color
I have a love hate relationship with matte lipgloss but I always love the Kylie lip kits and this color is perfect for every day wear. I change it up sometimes by adding a gloss on top too.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"very buttery and smooth
I’ve never tried Kylie cosmetics until now and I’m pleasantly surprised…the formula applies very smoothly and doesn’t dry out your lips!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"the perfect nude.
The liner is awesome. It's smooth, creamy & distributes pigment evenly. I actually like to do my entire lip with it. The liquid is a bit drying (as most matte liquids are), but not as drying as Smashbox. It wears well without cracking, or flaking. It's not drink proof.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"this shade is my absolute favorite.
I love this Kylie lip kit. It has an amazing soft texture, beautiful shade and coverage. The fact that it is cruelty free & vegan always adds an extra plus to my reviews. Absolutely beautiful lip kit.

I've never tried Kyle cosmetics products before and I'm pleasantly surprised! The lip liner was very creamy and pigmented and lasted all day. I liked the lipstick as well, I topped it with gloss because that's the look I prefer and it looked great!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"worth buying!
This lip kit is smooth on my lips, and I love the shade! I'm super pale, and it's hard for me to find lipsticks/glosses/etc that I like against my skin, but I've only ever had one from Kylie Cosmetics that I didn't like(and that was years ago).

",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i will order another one in this shade
I was surprised by how much I liked this product. It came with a lip liner and a matte liquid lipstick, that was the perfect shade for me. Application was smooth and it lasts a while before having to reapply.",kylie cosmetics,positive

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"posie k ??
This was my first time trying the Kylie lip kit in the shade posie k and I have to say I was amazed with the long lasting effect. The lip liner is creamy and very pigmented. The lipgloss is super moisturizing and easy to blend. I could easily eat a whole meal and not have to retouch. I must say I am impressed. Definitely want more shades ??",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"pretty color
I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The shade Bare is such a lovely color and the liner goes in like butter. My main concern is sharpening the pencil since the product breaks off easily and is easily wasted. So I used the lined my lips with the liner followed by lipstick which is very moisturizing and the best part is it doesn’t feel dry on lips. The shade is amazing to create the ombré look. Loved it!!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love this color!!
This is my first time trying these product from this brand. This Party Girl Velvet Lip Kit is the perfect duo for creating a velvety, demi-matte lip look. This Velvet Lip Kit includes a Velvet Liquid Lipstick and Lip Liner Pencil. These are Clean, Vegan, Cruelty Free and Gluten Free. This lip pencil has a super creamy formula that glides smoothly on the lips. It provides a smudge-free lip contour. This velvet liquid lipstick has creamy, lightweight formula that's easy to apply. This lipstick comes with a soft applicator and has a light vanilla scent. I feel comfortable when wearing this Kylie lip kit. I love this color very much - viriant pink.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love the packaging and smoothness
This lip kit set is moist & creamy, smooth and lightweight. The liquid lipstick and liner held about 4 hours my first try before my lips began feeling dry and the lipstick started creasing. My second try I prepped my lips using a lip balm beforehand and the liquid lipstick lasted longer. In honesty Im not a huge fan of the color on me. The color is very nice, but it doesnt do anything for my skin tone or bring me out. The lip kit is cutely packaged and extremely smooth. While this color doesn't fit me I would like to try other colors.",kylie cosmetics,positive

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"kylie cosmetics velvet lip kit in charm
i absolutely adored this lip kit!! the packaging is completely gorgeous - from the box to the tubes for the pencil and liquid lipstick - and super functional as well. i also loved the formula, because for a fairly matte lip i found it to be very comfortable and moisturizing. the color is also gorgeous, and i will consider purchasing it in the future!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"first time lip kit user
was so excited to try out a lip kit since I've never managed to get my hands on one! I made a bold choice going with the red velvet shade, but it has paired so nicely with my makeup looks! I'm not typically one to wear a full lip, I usually blend it out the center for that popsicle lip look! the formula was very very soft and easily blendable! i also love the matching pencil, it leaves no room for guessing when finding a liner. the product feels super lightweight on and stayed all day long, my only complaint is that it easily smudges. not a super big deal considering most lipsticks do! overall it's really nice!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"liked it
I’ve tried a few Kylie lip products before and they used to dry my lips. However, this one felt a little moisturizing and the color payoff was great! The lip liner was very easy to apply as well.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love this!!
I got the shade “Bare”. I’m obsessed with the color, it’s the perfect light nude! Formula isn’t as drying as her other liquid lipsticks and wear time is good!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"glides on effortlessly, and looked natural!
I’m not usually one who wears lip stick or uses a whole kit! But when I tried this Velvet lip kit by Kylie cosmetics I instantly realized what I’ve been missing out on. It’s not only a pop of color, but it looked natural and semi matte. The perfect combo for me! Absolutely loved getting to try this complimentary product out!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"absolutely love this
I love the pigment and the packaging. It is a great lipstick and lipliner duo and works amazingly without making it look patchy and dry.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"good quality , less pigmented
I liked the quality it lasts long and doesn’t leave my lips dry. However I was expecting it to be more pigmented for the shade I received. Overall I liked it might go for a darker shade next time",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"love the shade!!
I own a few Kylie Lip Kits but haven’t tried any since she changed her formula. I was happy to see they still smell good and the pigment is still great! I wore this color all day and reapplied once but if you’re careful with eating, you should get by with just one application and maybe some lip balm to even out the color throughout the day. Poise K was one of her first shades but I’ve never tried it until now. I love it! No wonder she’s kept it a staple in the brand. If you haven’t tried, I recommend at least getting one lip kit for the experience",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"perfect color!
Okay I’m a big fan of Kylie Lipstick already lol but the durability on this one is insane. Also the color is a perfect mix of pink and nude-ish.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"long lasting!
I was soooo excited to try this product and it did not disappoint. I followed the instructions on the package and I loved the look! Harmony is a fun, pink color, but not super bright. I like the muted hue. The gloss on top of the liner really finished off the look. Plus, the packaging is adorable. I’m a big fan!",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"i actually really like it
I appreciate it but the color for me was a little off but I'll still wear it. The consistency is good. the product is good",kylie cosmetics,neutral
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"great kit!
I loved the Kylie Velvet lip Kit!!!! From the packaging, the pencil to the liquid lipstick. The color would not be my first choice (party girl) but after trying it I loved how it looks. It is a slightly striking tone and they make the lips stand out very nicely. They are easily applied. First use the pencil to outline and fill in with liquid lipstick. I liked the result. I received this product for free from @kyliecosmetics and @influenster in exchange for my honest review. #incentivized",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"smoothest liner
I would definitely recommend this lip kit. The liner was absolutely buttery. It didn't tug on my lip at all when trying to apply it and it easily filled in my lips. The liner itself give a huge payoff with just one swipe same with the liquid lipstick. They don't have very much staying power and will easily wipe off but still leave some color. The liquid lipstick is not sticky as long as you only put a thin layer which is all you really need. The finish doesn't seem to be fully matte but I also wouldn't call it satin and definitely not glossy. It seems to be more matte with a slight gloss but looks more matte if you blot.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"long lasting beautiful color
Wore this all night for New Year’s Eve and it lasted great. No sticky texture, very light weight and the color was vibrant. I loved it! I never bought the Kylie lip because of the price, but after getting to test it I definitely will be looking into more colors. Worth every penny!",kylie cosmetics,positive

Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"really nice
I’m a brunette with super dark eyes and some blonde in my hair, my skin color has yellow undertones. This is a very nice color, but I think it would look better on someone with a lighter complexion. The product is nice, only issue is that it feels a tad bit chalky. If you moisturize your lips before applying you should be good. It lasts really long.",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"nice feel
This has a really nice texture on my lips… The color is darker than what I Thought it would be?. Also the lip liner doesn’t come with a lot? But overall I really liked these products and I am going to buy them in a different color?",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"so easy to use!
This was my first time trying a Kylie lip kit. I’ve never used lip liner before, but the liner in the Kylie lip kit goes on so smoothly! And the color stays on for a while and doesn’t dry out your lips",kylie cosmetics,positive
Velvet Liquid Lipstick,"surprisingly good!
Was expecting this to be very dry as many liquid lip products are for me. The lip liner was good to include as well and matched. The color I received was a little too light for my tastes as it kind of just matched my own lips, so I actually think I’m going to buy a different color!",kylie cosmetics,positive

Wooow!! The color is so beautiful so sexy, sensual. The color is strong. I really love it, My skin is medium baige and this color looks so PRETTY!! ??????",kylie cosmetics,positive

I’ve never tried any Kylie product and I’m glad that I waited so long! I remember hearing such bad things about it but I was pleasantly surprised with the lip kit that I got!

I will definitely be buying more of Kylie’s products!!!",kylie cosmetics,positive
