BRONZER,My favorite bronzer I’ve ever used. I love Kylie Cosmetics because her shade range is amazing. This bronzer is not chalky and looks great on all undertones. Not to mention the packaging is to die for.,kyliecosmetics,positive

BRONZER,This bronzer is buildable and pigmented. It doesn’t leave me looking orange or cakey. It blends smoothly too. It has a matte finish. I also like the packaging. This is one of the very few products I recommend from this brand.,kyliecosmetics,positive
BRONZER,The formula in this bronzer is TO DIE FOR! I love how buildable and natural this bronzer is. It blends so gorgeous into my skin and leaves a natural contour without the harsh lines! It also is a bang for your buck considering there is so much product to work with. There is a slight shimmer to her products which gives the skin a glowy and dewy effect! KYLIE COSMETICS Bronzer is the best!!! I recommend this to everyone! Kylie Cosmetics Pressed Bronzing Powder Kylie Cosmetics Pressed Bronzing Powder. Take a chance on this brand I promise you will not regret it!,kyliecosmetics,positive
BRONZER,"I got 2 shades of the bronzers because I wasn't sure which I would like best but Kylie Cosmetics never ceases to amaze me, I loved both of these shades.

BRONZER,"I'm really not big on bronzer unless I am either doing a full glam look, or I have on just mascara and want to just give my face a little something. This bronzer stays on all day. Very pigmented so a little goes a long way.",kyliecosmetics,positive

BRONZER,I got this product for a light summer bronzer. Not my favorite bronzer but maybe I just set high expectations after everything I’ve heard about her lipstick. The packaging is a bit difficult to open.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"Gives a very subtle and matte finish, with a neutral toned bronze that is not too warm and not too cold in tone. I wish there was a bit more pigment to this bronzer, but it still looks lovely on the skin and doesn’t emphasize texture.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,Not pigmented at all really have to work for it to show up and I also noticed it does get hard pan after a couple of uses.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"I love the color of this bronzer! It is perfect for girls that may be a little more on the fair side. The only downside is that you have to use a lot of product to get it to show up, and you really have to work with it.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"I love the color, but the product itself is not my favorite. It doesn’t seem to be super pigmented, so you have to layer it on to really see it. And the fall out is definitely more than other brands. Overall, it’s decent but definitely not my favorite.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"Incredibly pigmented, but to a fault. As a faker gal, this is too pigmented and looked like mud on my face. It can be difficult to blend out the excess.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"I do not like the color, it doesn't look like what is pictured on the website.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,It broke immediately when I opened it to take off the film. The shade wasn’t pigmented enough.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"Honestly, I did not like this powder at all every time I would put it on. It felt very cakey on me and it was so dry on me. It was literally horrible. It made me look so muddy and patchy. I definitely don’t think that the formula is good and also the color is just not good like the shades of this product looks very patchy and the blend ability of this product is not good at all either it is not blend into the skin no matter how much you try and no no matter what brush you use.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"I didn't like it because it caused my skin to dry out, not recommend.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,I was so excited to try this product because I love Kylie and I have tried her lip kit! But sadly this product came broken. I tried to test it but it was extremely messy and just didn’t work. I didn’t want to give one star because that seems too poor but I couldn’t give three or four because I didn’t get to honestly try the product.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I think Kylie Cosmetics sent me the wrong color, because I have very fair skin and this shade seems to be one of their medium/dark bronzers. Nonetheless, I wanted to give an honest review so I tested it anyway. I have had issues before with bronzers pulling orange on my skintone, but this one honestly looked a little yellow on me as it blended out. Overall, weird color in a way too dark shade, but the packaging is nice at least.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"The packaging of this product is really cute, I love the pink and metallic lettering. In terms of formula, I didn’t really like it. It’s patchy on application and doesn’t blend all that well. I received the wrong color and tried to make it work but aside from that the formula isn’t that good. There are much better bronzers out there at this same price point.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,I was beyond excited to try out this product and the color is amazing! But the product itself was damaged. Hoping to be able to get to try it soon if I get a replacement.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,I thought it was cute light and everything but it was just not pigmented!,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,Found this to be too dark and not what I was expecting.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"Oh, I thought the models advertising this shade did justice for the shade. It did not, it’s way too light than it is advertised.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,I am a little disappointed the bronzer was cracked upon opening but I was still able to test it and I like the bronzer overall.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"I loved the color & undertone of this bronzer, but it was so dry that the brush couldn't really pick up any product, let alone put any on the face. It's such a pretty color when you swatch it, but even swatching it, it is a bit hard to get pigment from the bronzer.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,This bronzer wasn’t the greatest; it has a nice bronze to it but not my favorite or go-to. I wish it was a little more pigmented and also kind of hard to blend in. I don’t think I would buy again.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"The shade is nice but I had to constantly reapply. I was underwhelmed by this, sadly. I really wanted to love it but it was okay.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,This bronzer has a really nice matte finish and is best for lighter skin tones. It does not go muddy on the face and gives a nice defined look. It is on the pricey end and I feel as though there is not much that is special about it.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"Mine came broken and was very expensive and the formula is phenomenal. The packaging is adorable but the product was broken and there wasn’t very much in there for the price that I paid. I repressed the pan and from what I’ve used so far I really like it, just wish it was cheaper for the amount of product you get.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"I'm giving this 3 stars because 1) my shade was way too light... I bought it online. That is my mistake, but I'm pretty fair skinned and if it was too light for me I don't know that many others would actually be able to use it. 2) I've simply used much better quality bronzers before.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,I personally wasn’t a big fan of this bronzer. I loved the blush but the bronzer seemed a little chalky & had easy fall out.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,It's your basic bronzer and the name does not change that. You pay for the brand with this product. I personally prefer my supermarket's own brand to this.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"Pigment is definitely there, it is not that bad but I definitely was not impressed at all! I am usually warm-toned skin and it didn’t really go well with me.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"Unfortunately, this bronzer - which was supposed to be in the shade Khaki - was WAY darker than the old formula which I used to love. This one is not for fair skin, sadly. I do love the actual powder quality; that part is very nice... so for someone with deeper skin tones this may work for you!",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,I really wanted to love this but it does not blend out at all! And once I get it to the point of blending it’s like I didn’t even apply any to begin with! I even got a different shade and still no luck. Bummed out.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,Ordered twice and it came in broken both times. Love the color but the quality for the price did disappoint me.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"Unfortunately, I cannot review this item as it came broken and not possible to use. Influenster customer service has not been responsive to my emails.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,It was completely smashed & shattered when I received it.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"Not pigmented enough, I have the exact same shade but it shows more color.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,Quality not the best. I thought the consistency was going to be different.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"Good product but came broken, can’t get a refund. Waste of money.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"It was broken when I received it. Tried to reach out by email, no response from Kylie’s people.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,Pretty color for my skin tone but it was too chalky just like the blush unfortunately. Sucks because bronzer is hard to find with a good shade for pale girls like me. I wish the pigmentation was better but her products just seem to be lacking in everything but the shades.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,Way too dark. I was trying to replace a KWW palette that I love.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,This bronzer is so patchy and looks so bad on my skin. I never had a good experience with this product. I wouldn’t recommend it.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,I read reviews that said to apply a generous amount to the brush before applying. I did and it still didn’t show up hardly at all and that’s saying something coming from someone as fair as myself. I don’t understand why the old formula was great and this one falls short.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"Was broken. When I opened it up, it got all over my white coat and the carpet.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"I just can’t seem to get any pigment from Kylie’s bronzers. They’re not bad colors but the problem is I can’t get the color to show up on my skin. As I am very pale, not having a bronzer show up on my skin is very abnormal. Unfortunately, I can’t recommend this product because I can’t test its longevity after it is put on.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,There really is no color to it. I was looking for some tanning look.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,This bronzer was surprisingly great to work with. The color applies nicely and was easy to build up. I really liked how it went on! Definitely would recommend!,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"I like the blush and bronzer from KYLIE it’s easy to blend and affordable, color is perfect.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,At first I didn’t like this product at all because I was used to using a larger fluffy brush to apply my bronzer and I wasn’t getting any payoff from this bronzer however after using a smaller denser brush I fell in love with this bronzer. It’s pressed super hard but it blends easier builds very well and looks extremely smooth on my skin,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,The quality of this setting powder is super and I will buy it again!,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,Love using this to bronze my skin. Blends really nice and I love the packaging. Always bring it with me,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,I absolutely love this bronzer. It is the perfect shade for me and goes on so well. The way it looks on my face I just absolutely love it !! This is my go to bronzer for any look. The only downside for me is that I have to use a good amount of the product for it to show a difference but other than that I love this product.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"This is a good matte bronzer, but in my opinion it’s just not the best. There’s not a lot of variety’s in shade. So for me the lightest shade is too light then it jumps to a caramel color that is too dark for me. The actual powder doesn’t come out good either and you really have to dig to get color out and to show, but once it does it looks good.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"The product is very pretty! I love the packaging and colors of choice. The white on pink is so cute. The pigment is also very well, but this product doesn't stand out to me, I feel like it's a normal blush, nothing too special. I gave it 4 stars because it's pretty and it works but I wouldn't necessarily say you have to buy it.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"It’s a little tricky because you have to build it up to get a nice color. It’s nice for lighter skin and even complexions. Pigmented. Wouldn’t buy again, but still using it cause it lasts very long. KYLIE COSMETICS Bronzer",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"I like this bronzer a lot and used it for a long time but when comparing it to other powder bronzers that I have used (Benefit Hoola is my favorite/go-to), it is not nearly as pigmented and I felt like I had to use a lot more product to get the color I wanted which sometimes ended up looking too orangey. I purchased one of the darkest shades and I am semi-fair skinned so that shouldn’t be the case. I do tend to go heavy on the bronzer though. The compact, however, is pretty large and lasts a long time, I just wish the pigment showed up better on my skin.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"Have never found a bronzer that was just the right amount of warmth. This one is perfect. Light but not sheer, buildable without being patchy, and shapes my face like a dream. A bit expensive though!",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"I bought this thinking it was my perfect bronzer shade but it’s a bit lighter than I would like even though it looks pretty dark in the picture, but it’s still a really good bronzer and I use it when I’m going for a more natural look.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,It’s okay just that I chose the wrong color but the blend is nice though ! The pigmentation reminds me of NARS but it’s a nice finish ! Just make sure your face is fully set before applying.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,This product wasn't my right shade so that's why I gave it 3 stars but I still like the formula and if it was my shade I would definitely use this on daily basis.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,It’s a good dark tan color. The quality is not the best though. It doesn’t come onto the brush very good and doesn’t last as long as other bronzers I use now.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"This bronzer is pretty, nice packaging, + great buildable color. But it’s not for me. It made me look a bit dirty + ashy. I’ve used powdered bronzers before but this one didn’t want to work for me. I received this bronzer from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,I was hoping for it to have more of a rich color and settle nicely on the skin but I expected a little bit more. It was nice I loved the color and the packaging was cute. Maybe I got too light of a color. Cute overall but I expected a little more.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"Not very impressed. The bronzer blends very nicely as you can in the photo. But it’s a little too orange for my liking. Also it’s very powdery when picked up, but it’s fine on the skin once blended in. Overall it’s alright, but nothing special.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"The color of the Kylie Cosmetics Pressed Bronzing powder looks very nice and did seem very pigmented. Unfortunately, mine came broken so I was unable to truly try it and review it since I didn’t receive a replacement.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"Color is nice but I do not really care for the formula… Like most products I have tried of this brand, this was kind of patchy and on the harder side to blend (for me)",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,For the price it’s not that bad considering it’s only $20. It isn’t my favorite product Kylie Jenner has put out in terms of makeup. There is color payoff & it does blend fine,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"[I received this product, complementary from Influenster] I was pretty pleased when I found out I was receiving this pressed bronzer, it is my FIRST and only Kylie cosmetic product. The packaging was cute, and I received it pretty quick. I like the bronzer, but I wouldn’t have purchased it myself if it were up to me. It’s not as “blend-able” as my drugstore bronzer, it doesn’t do well if I try to build it up, but it is a pretty shade. I enjoyed trying out this product, but I will definitely not purchase.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,It is very long lasting and is very pigmentation and has a good packaging it also smells good it also blends out very easily and it looks good. It is very good!,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"This bronzer is nice. It blends out seamlessly and the color I picked is flattering and works well. I have a medium deep skin tone and I picked up the shade (Tawny Miami). I don’t think this will work for anyone darker, honestly. Feel free to try though. My main issue with this bronzer stems from the actual product itself. The bronzer was not fully in the pan. When I pushed it down to be in the pan it cracked. I was able to blend out the cracks so that it didn’t fall out. I only pushed it in because another cheek product I bought fell out and I didn’t want the bronzer to, but regardless it should be in the pan. I shouldn’t have to push it in to fit it in. The quality in terms of formula is there, but in terms of packaging it is not.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"I haven't tried this powder yet. But the package is cute. It was sad because the powder was broke when it delivered....I will try it, I hope it still works",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,When I unboxed my bronzer it was shattered. The packaging is clearly not strong enough to make it through shipping without damaging the product,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,The color Almond was a little too dark for my skin tone. I barely tapped it with my brush and onto my skin and it was very pigmented onto my skin. I did have to buff it out with a different brush. I do like how a little goes a long way but I would most likely pick a lighter or different shade. It’s not bad but I would definitely choose a different shade.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,The color of this bronzer is absolutely gorgeous and looks great on the skin BUT I feel like there are better options in the market for the price point. I wish it was a bit more pigmented/creamy formula.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"I like the color, but it came shattered, I tried emailing a few times about it but never got a return response. Kinda disappointing because it’s hard to use and I’m losing a lot of product every time I open it due to it being a shallow case.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,The color is really nice for this bronzer but it is very muddy when on the skin. It is good for the summer or when you are tan but I have used better bronzers.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,A good bronzing powder to add color to the skin. The bronzer is easy to blend. The only thing to change is how it lasts. It fades throughout the day.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"This blusher is pretty when first applied but gets patchier throughout the day. I think the shade I got was just a bit too warm toned for me. This is definitely buildable as it isn’t the most pigmented bronzer I’ve ever worked with, but overall not a bad bronzer",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"This bronzer is OK. I feel like there are more affordable and better options out there. I haven't tried the reformulation but honestly, I feel like most Kylie Cosmetics products are just a name brand. I think you can find better for cheaper. They just don't meet expectations",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"I definitely do not recommend. I really hated this product. It had zero stay, had to blend without it looking patchy. Overall I'd say a very low quality product. I would not buy again & would probably stay away from Kylie Cosmetics in the future.",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,Great bronzer Would I recommend no there are other alternatives out there that are better do love the packaging I think it’s more,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,the Kylie Cosmetics bronzer is super blendable and buildable. I use it with a brush and I love how it applies to my skin. I have medium to tan skin and it looks really nice.,kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"I have used this product a lot and it still doesn’t seem to be finished! The pigmentation is good and the color is very nice, it does not make me look orange or muddy. I think I will repurchase!",kyliecosmetics,negative
BRONZER,"gorgeous formula
This bronzer applied like a dream! It was super creamy and blendable but a powder format so application was super easy. The shade I received was red toned too which gave me a sunkissed look",kyliecosmetics,positive

This bronzer is very pigmented and makes you look like you’ve been out in the sun. It contours just the right amount where it’s not too sharp or too light. Love it!! very blendable and easy to use",kyliecosmetics,positive
BRONZER,"amazing
The color of the palette spreads well. It is so easy to get on the brush. It doesn’t even take that many swipes for it to apply and look good! I would so purchase this again! The design is also very easy to open and compact.

This product works great! The color can match anyone. It stays on all day! Give you a natural but full bronze. I like it more than my previous bronzer and it does not have any fallout. It is very sturdy and the packaging feels great and looks amazing.",kyliecosmetics,positive
